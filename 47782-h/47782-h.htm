<p class="par first">This is a story founded on truth. Practically
every incident told about really happened; yet some liberty has been
taken with the arrangements of these incidents into a story. Events are
sometimes grouped outside of their natural order and place of
occurrence, and the time of action is shortened. Conversation is
necessarily invented, and is used to bring out the setting of the story
and give it life. Another thing: Every writer recognizes that it is
desirable to not have too many characters in a story, and to not drag
it through unimportant incidents. Therefore, I have omitted many
incidents of the occupation of the Philippines, and have in places
ascribed to one person, in an effort to keep down the number of
characters, acts which properly belonged to other persons, so that some
of the characters are representative and composite. To illustrate my
meaning&mdash;that a love story in the simplest form might run through
the tale I have made Saguanaldo appear as a lover as well as a general,
though this is acknowledged to be fiction. In other places I have one
character doing a work that was really done by a different person; but
it would have been difficult and confusing to use all the actors in the
stirring drama or to refer to all the many incidents. This shortening
of the period of action, and this combining in one person the deeds of
several, is something which Shakespeare did in his historical dramas;
so that this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e236" href="#xd21e236"
name="xd21e236">6</a>]</span>is historical in the same sense that some
of his plays are historical&mdash;not as to the truth of every word and
the time and place of every act, but in spirit and in incident. The
truth is there, but the grouping is made to meet the author&rsquo;s
need.</p>
<p class="par">There is no personal bias in this work. It is nothing to
the author that in this case the center of the plot hinges about
churchmen. It is no more than if it should center around secular
affairs. It is the old story of personal ambition which has appeared in
a thousand forms and has influenced all conditions of people. It is not

<p class="par first">Up till midnight Manila was at play. In
medi&aelig;val Luzon they had not then lost the sportive instinct of
the healthy animal or been lost in the chase of the dollar. The shops
were closed, but the places of amusement were open. The Lunita, outside
the city wall, was thronged with carriages, and at each end of the
Plaza de Gotta a band was playing. Spanish grandees and beautiful
donnas were driving or promenading there. Inside the wall churches and
theatres were open, the churches being first visited and then the play
houses. In the amphitheater, built up of bamboo, a crowd of the poorer
people were gathered, and while the braver battles were not in progress
at this time, cock fighting was attracting the attention of many. Under
the walls of the old city, the city that best represented the ancient
order, the city of this story, in cloisters arched over where stock was
being housed, groups of men were throwing dice or playing cards. It was
like a picture of the middle ages projected into the closing days of
April, 1898.</p>
<p class="par">What an anomaly it was! Walls of the middle ages,
surrounded by a great moat, and within a cosmopolitan group, including
Spaniards, Chinese and natives of the Northern islands; yet adjoining
it to the east lay a modern city; and <span class="corr" id="xd21e255"
title="Source: CaVite">Cavite</span>, eight miles to the west, was a
fort manned by modern guns. Yellow clay houses of one and two stories
roofed with red tile, some with courts in the center, here in old
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e258" href="#xd21e258" name=
"xd21e258">8</a>]</span>Manila, and to the east modern places of
business and houses well plumbed, lighted with electricity. Churches
and cathedrals, conventos and nunneries everywhere here, and beyond the
Passig river modern amusement places and Protestant churches.</p>
<p class="par">In the magnificent harbor that lay north of Manila,
small crafts of many kinds were grouped at the piers, and in the
distance the modern fleet of Spain lay at anchor. It was the one
portion of the old order that yet remained; and the world was pressing
upon it, and change was near.</p>
<p class="par">Ambrosia Lonzello, the Friar&rsquo;s Daughter, stood at
the gate in front of her mother&rsquo;s home, gazing down the street,
dreaming the dreams of oriental maidenhood. She had inherited the
symmetry of proportion that belonged to her mother&rsquo;s tribe in
Cebu, and from her father, Bishop Lonzello, had the Spaniard&rsquo;s
dark eyes and charming vivacity. It had been twenty years since Friar
Lonzello, a young priest then located in Cebu, had met the young native
woman who became Ambrosia&rsquo;s mother; and though it was forbidden
priests to marry, Lonzello yet supported the woman he had then loved
and the daughter that had been born to them. If it was a strange thing
to a European, it was rather the rule than the exception in that
oriental, mediaeval country, and as the daughter of the Bishop,
Ambrosia was one of the prominent young women of the walled city. She
stood, gazing down the street and up at the stars, dreaming her own
dreams, a girl without experience in the ways of the world, when she
heard a voice at her side:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ambrosia! <i lang="es">Buenos
dias!</i>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e269src" href="#xd21e269"
name="xd21e269src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">Ambrosia started. She knew the voice. But she supposed
the possessor, Camillo Saguanaldo, was across the bay in China. A few
months before he had been banished because of leading an insurrection
against the friars, who were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e276"
href="#xd21e276" name="xd21e276">9</a>]</span>practically the rulers of
the Philippines, and his return involved great danger for him. So
Ambrosia said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I thought you were in China, Camillo. Do you not
know it is dangerous for you to be in Luzon?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My duty calls me here, Ambrosia, and here I must
be,&rdquo; replied the youth. &ldquo;It is not so dangerous now as it
has been in the past. At last our prayers are to be answered and
America, the great land that loves liberty, is to give us a chance to
secure our freedom. If we do our part we shall be free. When I was in
China I talked with Admiral Rainey, of the American fleet that was
anchored there, and he told me that the United States was about to go
to war with Spain solely to secure liberty for the Cubans; and when I
told him how it was in the Philippines, that we had been struggling for
liberty for three hundred years, he said that it might be that Uncle
Sam would do for us what he meant to do for the <i>reconcentrados</i>
of Cuba. So I came over in advance to help when the only chance the
Filipinos ever had shall come to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I wish it might be, Camillo,&rdquo; replied the
girl. &ldquo;But if my father hears you have returned, he will kill
you, and nothing can appease his wrath now.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It might be mentioned that when the insurrection led by
Saguanaldo had failed and his banishment was decreed, Bishop Lonzello,
at the intercession of Ambrosia, had procured for him an allowance of
$20,000 on which to live in China. Ambrosia had intended it as a
kindness to him, and the bishop regarded it as a bribe, but now that he
had returned there was no doubt that Lonzello would prosecute him and
if possible secure his death.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I shall be safe.&rdquo; replied the youth.
&ldquo;I used that $20,000 in buying guns and ammunition, and have
already a stronger force than I ever had. My troops are near at hand
even now, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e292" href="#xd21e292"
name="xd21e292">10</a>]</span>and Manila is not so peaceful as she
seems.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You do not know. The heavy guns of the
battleships have been mounted at <span class="corr" id="xd21e296"
title="Source: Carregidor">Corregidor</span> and Caney, and the 160,000
Spanish troops in the city laugh at the idea of America ever being able
to take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yet America will take it. The American fleet will
be here and will win, and then they will give us freedom. Within a few
months the Filipinos will be free, and then Ambrosia Lonzello will
become Ambrosia de Saguanaldo.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The young girl flushed with combined embarrassment and
pleasure.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It can not be,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am not
worthy of you. I shall seek with you the freedom of the Filipinos and
then I shall die and leave you free to marry a woman who has a
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Fie, Ambrosia. I will give you my name, and there
will be none in Luzon more honored than that. Many have tried for the
good that now we shall attain. It must come. The very fact that we have
waited for it so long proves that it must be near. <i>Luz de mi
vida</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e309src" href="#xd21e309" name=
"xd21e309src">2</a>, it is so.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; the girl began wistfully, then
stopped abruptly. &ldquo;Father is so bitter against you. I always wish
you with me, yet you never come but I am anxious you should go, lest
staying mean your death.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Fear not, Ambrosia,&rdquo; said the youth.
&ldquo;They call me the Fox of Luzon, and I find my way where they do
not suspect. I was with your father yesterday and he never
knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, take no risk,&rdquo; plead the girl, throwing
herself in his arms. &ldquo;<i lang="es">Te amo con todo el
corazon.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e322src" href="#xd21e322" name=
"xd21e322src">3</a> You must, you must be careful. Oh, it is sad, so
sad. If they would only let us have a chance the people might be so
happy. Luzon is a beautiful island. It seems to me like Paradise, the
garden of the Lord; and yet for us it is purgatory.&rdquo; <span class=

prevail.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Camillo, come inside, or they will see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She drew the young man into the shadows, and into the
house. There the lovers talked undisturbed. They talked of things that
to them were the most momentous&mdash;their own loves and their
individual plans, the hope and future of the island which had been
their home all their lives. Little did they know that time was working
for them and through them more momentous changes that should affect
continents and end completely the feudal in the capitalistic.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">On the following morning Manila was awakened by the roar
of artillery. It was still dark save for the star light, yet quickly
the streets were in turmoil. Some grasped the things they most valued
and rushed to most ridiculous places for safety. One man took to the
woods with a fighting cock under his arm. A few of the bravest mounted
to the roofs of the dwellings and the towers of the churches in order
to view the fight that had been anticipated, but which had come sooner
than expected. From these vantage points they looked on a scene such as
falls to the lot of man to observe only once in a thousand lives.</p>
<p class="par">In answer to the challenge of <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e351" title="Source: CaVite">Cavite</span> the American fleet was
forming in battle array. In single file, as if in gala parade, they
came, like actors entering from the wings of a great stage or circus
performers from the dressing room, crawling over the white bay like
living things. The dawn had come, suddenly as in the tropics, come with
the roar of artillery. For once it had literally realized
Kipling&rsquo;s line&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Dawn comes up like thunder outer China
&rsquo;crost the bay.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">At last the fleet, the tool of the new order of
capitalism, was ready. The command had gone forth from Admiral
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e359" href="#xd21e359" name=
"xd21e359">12</a>]</span>Rainey: &ldquo;You may fire when you are
ready.&rdquo; The American flag ship shot a line of fire, and from the
smoke that arose a great roar resounded. Boom, boom! Fire and shell and
smoke and action swept from consciousness the peace of nature and
thought of the world of life. Now and then the white veil of smoke
would lift, and the watcher on the towers could see in those intervals
splintered masts and laboring vessels, specks that were men struggling
in the waves, and wrecks that lined the shore. It did not seem possible
that all those specks were men, with hopes and plans and families, and
hearts and bodies that suffered; the watchers on the towers could not
know that decks of vessels were slippery from blood, and that nerves
were racked with pain and hearts were sore from loss. The American
vessels, crawling like water mites over the white mirror spread below
them, circled together about first one and then another of the Spanish
ships; and ever as they moved flashes like fiery legs stretched from
their sides. This red venom of death touched the Spanish ships that
appeared to wither and consume before it. Here a Spanish ship ran to
shore, as though a living, wounded thing, seeking a place to die, and,
trembling, sank beneath the waves. There a vessel lay under the
pitiless pelting of fire, till there was a heavy explosion, and the
ship was torn to shreds that sprinkled the water, while dots that
represented men struggled in the waves. Yonder a vessel was on fire,
and as it bore to shore specks that were men dived into the water to
save themselves, and the red flames licked life from the redder
decks.</p>
<p class="par">With what precision the stranger ships came on,
circling, and pouring death into the helpless vessels whose wooden
hulks graft had left exposed to shell! How aimlessly and helplessly the
Spanish vessels floundered, unable to fight, and finding no escape! It
was war, glorious and terrible. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e363"
href="#xd21e363" name="xd21e363">13</a>]</span>In Spain a thousand
widows and orphans would weep and miss forever that which had been
taken from them in a quarrel in which the fighters had no interest. In
America a million would scream for joy and tingle with the glory of
slaughter and the thought of being splendid fighters. Within half an
hour nearly four hundred able-bodied men perished and twenty million
dollars&rsquo; worth of property that should have been used to make
life happier and better was destroyed. It was a great drama, in a
splendid amphitheatre, with the lifting curtains of night to show it
forth, enacted for the few in the towers. Ambrosia had seen and
understood and was silenced by the grandeur and horror of it. She felt
for the dying, and could hardly restrain herself from crying out in
agony when the American fleet ceased firing and calmly moved away to
prepare, within sight of the wrecks and the sacrifice, breakfast for
the living, after their hour&rsquo;s toil.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, God, but this is horrible,&rdquo; she
muttered, faint with her feelings. As she spoke, once again she was
startled with a voice at her side. She turned to behold an old man with
a long beard, but she knew the voice, the voice of Saguanaldo, and it
said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ambrosia, <i>chuleta</i>, it is the dawn, not
only of a new day, but also of a new era.&rdquo; <span class=

<p class="par first">&ldquo;A beautiful city, Admiral Rainey&mdash;from
a distance. Strongly fortified&mdash;for the fifteenth century. But you
can sweep away the fortifications as easily as you sank the Spanish war
vessels. What is a walled city with a moat to guns that will carry for
miles?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I do not doubt, General Saguanaldo,&rdquo;
returned the American admiral as he sat on deck of his flag ship in the
harbor of Manila, faultlessly garbed as though for a party, talking to
the Filipino insurgent after the battle that had spread his name around
the globe, &ldquo;I do not doubt my ability to reduce the Spanish
works, but I was looking to the future. Should I destroy so much
private property as would be involved in bombarding Manila I would make
enemies of the owners, who would give us trouble in days to come. I
dare not take such a serious step until I am instructed from
America.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But consider, admiral,&rdquo; plead the
insurgent, &ldquo;Manila sits there, fair to see, but she has drawn the
very life from the people of the interior for centuries. The private
property of which you speak was gotten from labor by the sorrow of
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are doubtless right, general, and I would not
blame you if you should seek revenge from them, for your people have
suffered greatly. But with me it is a different proposition. I am not
acting for myself alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nor am I. It may be you do not know the sorrows
of Luzon, <span class="corr" id="xd21e388" title=
"Source: Senor">Se&ntilde;or</span> Admiral!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e391" href="#xd21e391" name=

<p class="par">&ldquo;It may be I do not, General
Saguanaldo.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;May I tell you of them, Admiral
Rainey?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I shall be pleased to know more of this land that
I have just come to command until my country tells me what to do, or
ends the unhappy war.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When Spaniards from Mexico first landed in
Maynila, centuries ago,&rdquo; continued General Saguanaldo, &ldquo;the
simple-minded natives bowed to the white people as to gods; and they
have been on their knees rendering tribute of Luzon&rsquo;s products
ever since. It did not take the natives long to learn the nature of the
Spaniards, who were inflamed by the lust of gold, both by their
experience with the Incas and Aztecs in America and by the hard terms
of the Spanish rulers, for we have had to pay tribute to Rome, to Spain
and to Mexico&mdash;all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am told the people of the interior are
primitive&mdash;half naked Igorrotes, or Negritos, wearing only breech
clouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Those live chiefly in the Southern islands. The
body of the people of the Northern islands are of the Malayan stock,
loving liberty, but kept poor by tributes exacted. They were a people
of simple ways and homely virtues. Because of being of Malayan descent
they wore called Moros by the Spaniards. The two tribes of Moros, the
Tagals of Northern Luzon, and the Viscayans of Southern Luzon and North
Mindoro, yielded to Legaspi, to whom the king of Spain gave all the
land he might conquer. He was not a hard master, leaving the olden,
native chiefs in charge; but when, after this, the friars came from
Spain, they began the work of oppression. When the great earthquake
destroyed Maynila in 1645, and over 600 perished in the catastrophe,
the natives were forced to work without pay on the arsenal at Ca Vite,
and when, because of harsh treatment, they rebelled, burning towns and
churches, the friars dispatched soldiers for the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e405" href="#xd21e405" name=
"xd21e405">16</a>]</span>head of Sumoroy, the rebel. His followers sent
in the head of a pig instead. The enraged friars and soldiers tortured
to death the mother of Sumoroy, and afterward, when the rebel was
betrayed to them, struck off his head and mounted it on a pole for the
people to look upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Brutal, doubtless. But such things were common in
those days,&rdquo; returned the admiral.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;God pity us, they are too common in Manila in
these days. The reputation of the friars was such in those days that
when some of them went to Japan it was reported in that land that they
were advance guards of the Spanish army, getting a foothold, and that
after them would come the army to protect them. The Mikado ordered the
friars out, but they defied him. Then the Japanese emperor adopted
heroic measures. He gathered together 150 lepers and sent them to
Maynila, saying that Japan did not allow Roman friars in that country,
but, since these friars were fond of this kind of people, he sent them
a ship load.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That, too, seems to have been inhuman. How were
the lepers received?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, the friars built the hospital of St. Lazarus
for their reception. You can see it beyond those palms.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That was rather a Christian act.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The friars have done some good. But they insist
on foreign friars ruling instead of native priests, and to maintain
their supremacy keep the people uneducated. Then they claim ownership
of large tracts of the best land, and exact high rentals. The people
have rebelled against their exactions over and over again. Long ago the
king of Tagals killed the alcade of Tayabas province, and made the
people believe that the earth would swallow the Spaniards when they
were attacked, but his rebellion was put down with great
slaughter.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e419" href=
"#xd21e419" name="xd21e419">17</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No wonder, General. This confirms my information
that the inhabitants are not free from superstition.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i lang="es">Eso fue en los dias
antiguos</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e426src" href="#xd21e426" name=
"xd21e426src">1</a>, Admiral. The people were crude then. Perhaps they
were like your American Indians. But they were oppressed, and they
began even then the rebellion against Spain and the friars which they
have maintained for over 300 years, from the days when Soliman, the
native king, set fire to Maynila and fought them from the forests, to
the last rebellion of Rizal and the religious deflection of
Aglipay.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It seems to me a man of ability, like you,
General, ought to be able to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We will win. But we have hoped so that the great
North American nation that pitied Cuba and that is fighting for her
independence will so pity us and give us independence. I assure you,
Admiral, we have endured longer and more than Cuba has done. The
oppression had been admitted by our masters. The Augustinians and
Jesuits accused each other of <span class="corr" id="xd21e436" title=
"Source: curelty">cruelty</span> and the Jesuits were banished. It was
not till 1859 that they were permitted to return. I told you about the
destruction of Manila by earthquake in the olden days. That was not the
last or worst seismic disturbance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I had heard as much.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In 1863 the city was again destroyed by
earthquake, which killed thousands of people and left much destitution.
The grafting that followed was scandalous and caused much
dissatisfaction. It was in 1872 that the great insurrection occurred.
But for an error in signals which started the trouble before the people
were ready to support it, it would have succeeded. As it was, many were
executed and shot. At another time the people were promised amnesty if
they would lay down their arms, but when they did so thousands were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e443" href="#xd21e443" name=
"xd21e443">18</a>]</span>massacred. Then came a period of organizing
secret societies to work against the friars, who were also
rulers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But these are only incidents that come in the
history of every land.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i lang="es">Por Dios, Donde se hallaria otro
pais que has sufrido tanto.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e451src"
href="#xd21e451" name="xd21e451src">2</a> Think of it! Up to 1811 the
Philippine islands dared not trade with any country but Mexico, not
excepting their neighbor, China. Then the picturesque, half-moon-shaped
galleons of Mexico did all the carrying of the Philippines and charged
prices such as would enrich them in spite of the pirates they
frequently met. For this trade Mexican promoters and the Spanish crown
received their tribute, and the Spanish friars, too, had their share.
The people were abjectly poor. Even the soldiers were often unpaid, and
begged their support from the people whom they subjected. The friars
charged exorbitant rentals on the lands they claimed. They encouraged
the people to build cathedrals, monasteries and churches, but the
cathedrals, monasteries and churches did not belong to the people after
they had built them. They charged the people rental on graves in
consecrated ground, and when the rent was not paid they evicted the
dead. They made the price of marriage so high that many of the people
lived together out of wedlock. The friars selected the women of the
people they fancied and openly consorted with them, and the children of
friars are common throughout the islands. The people are poor, living
for the most part in grass houses, while the friars are rich and live
in luxury; and this has been going on for centuries.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bad, very bad; the morals of the tropics and the
Orient.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This is not all. The friars exercised the power
of secret investigation, and one never knew when he was safe. A friar
might report a man as a conspirator against Spain, and, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e469" href="#xd21e469" name=
"xd21e469">19</a>]</span>while meeting him and showing friendship for
him in public, secretly secure his banishment. There have been cases
which I could name, where friars, coveting the wife or sister of a man,
have procured his banishment or even secured for him an appointment at
a distance, so that they might have the way open to accomplish their
purposes. There was a fear which beset every man, even those who
through fear were nearest to the friars, that if his eyes should light
upon his wife or daughter in an envious way, if he did not give them up
he was lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Surely, General, this is exaggerated.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The half has not been told. In Lenten time, which
was the period when the country folk came to confess, the parish friar
would give strict orders to the scribes of the church that in the
distribution or giving out of the certificates to the penitents among
himself and his coadjutors they should give him the young unmarried
women and servant penitents, whom he obscenely solicited through words
and manipulations in the confessional.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why, this is horrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is, indeed. Some reverend friars arrogated to
themselves rights which in feudal times were called rights of
<i>pernada</i>, or the right to enter the bed of a new bride before the
husband. The parish friar converted himself up to a certain point into
an absolute lord, master of lives and property, and, if he so willed,
made and unmade everything according to his fancy. Master of the will
of the people more through fear than out of love for him, he nominated
town authorities that pleased him, which nomination elevated almost
always the greatest flatterer of all his parishioners, and it is plain
that all weighty determinations dictated by the municipal authorities
were not proper initiatives, but those of his amours.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e482" href="#xd21e482" name=

<p class="par">&ldquo;It does not seem possible. Why, that is worse
than Cuba.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Imagine paying rental on a grave for the bones of
a dear one, until your money was exhausted, and then seeing the remains
dumped into a pile of bones along with scores of other victims. Imagine
being required to produce a certain crop each year to be turned over to
the friars, and if you failed, becoming indebted to them so that there
was no hope of your ever paying out. Imagine being compelled to sell
your rice to the friar at the price he might offer, and being forbidden
to take it to an open market where the price was higher. Would you
rebel against such conditions?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The American would not tolerate it even for a
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That is not all. They were cruel, not only in the
treatment of their servants by beating them, but they also took great
delight in being eye witnesses to tortures and beatings of men and in
prisons and jails by the civil authorities. They were always, when
witnessing these acts, accompanied by some of the higher Spanish civil
authorities, and these acts were usually carried out at the instigation
of the friars.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I did not know of all these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Would to God that you knew, Admiral. Listen! In
1781 the growing of tobacco on Luzon was made a government monopoly. If
farmers refused to plant a certain amount of tobacco the land was taken
from them. Law required the natives to &rsquo;tend the tobacco that
when raised belonged to the government; that is, to the friars. If the
crop was less than the amount estimated for each farmer, he was heavily
fined and became responsible for that much more the year following. If
the crop was above the estimate, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e496" href="#xd21e496" name="xd21e496">21</a>]</span>the
government seized it all and destroyed what it could not sell to
advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No doubt you have suffered much.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Cuba does not know suffering, Admiral. Yet you
liberty-loving Americans are warring to give Cuba her freedom. Give us
freedom, too. Promise me, Admiral.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The insurgent general, with the impetuosity of the
tropics, fell on his knees before Admiral Rainey and seized his
hands.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;America will see you have your rights.
Arise,&rdquo; the admiral said, flipping a speck from his coat as he
spoke. The insurgent leader reverently kissed the hand of the admiral,
and, crying, &ldquo;You will be hailed as the great emancipator,&rdquo;
signaled to his attendants, and prepared to leave the flagship. Under
Rainey&rsquo;s guns the company made its way to shore, not far from the
old moat outside the city&rsquo;s walls, now overgrown with grasses and
vegetation, which served for draining the outlying country.

<h2 class="label">III.</h2>
<h2 class="main">WON BY A WOMAN.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As General Saguanaldo and his men drew to shore, a
small English woman approached him from a clump of bamboos that grew
near the shore, hiding the new city from sight.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What do you here, Madam Rizal?&rdquo; asked
Saguanaldo, bowing low. &ldquo;You always bear important
news.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have a circular which Bishop Lonzello has been
distributing throughout Luzon. Did you win a promise from the admiral
to aid us in our struggle?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He told me to go ahead and do the best I could
against the Spaniards.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But no promise definitely to help us gain our
independence?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;N-o, I can&rsquo;t say that he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Grant me permission, then, to lay this document
before him. I am of his own race, and believe I can induce him to aid
our cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let me see the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Rizal handed the paper to the insurgent general,
and as he read stood gazing abstractedly over the water. She was yet a
young woman, but her face revealed both sorrow and determination. She
was the widow of the late insurgent, Dr. Rizal, who was the best
educated and probably the most manly of all who had opposed the
exactions of the friars in the interest of the native population. He
had accomplished but very little, and only a short time before had been
shot by the Spanish soldiery, at the instigation of Lonzello
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e530" href="#xd21e530" name=
"xd21e530">23</a>]</span>and others. The widow, after that event,
seemed to have no object in life but to carry on the work her husband
had begun, and became an invaluable aid to Saguanaldo. She grasped
situations he could not understand. She advised with the good sense of
a veteran. She went from place to place, singing, talking and
encouraging. She was always active in the cause of Philippine
independence, and no task, no privation, was so great as to deter her.
But perhaps the service that most appealed to the Filipino leader came
through her friendship with Ambrosia Lonzello. She managed that the
<i>aling</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e534src" href="#xd21e534" name=
"xd21e534src">1</a> might meet her lover, and at the same time
protected them from the friar, her father, so that he never suspected
that his enemy was the lover of his daughter.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Go, and God bless you,&rdquo; said the insurgent,
after he had finished reading the friar&rsquo;s address.</p>
<p class="par">Again the boat pushed from shore, this time bearing, not
Saguanaldo, but Mrs. Rizal. When they arrived at the American flagship
the woman introduced herself to Admiral Rainey and gave a history of
her husband&rsquo;s struggle and his fate. There was more feeling in
her recital than there had been in Saguanaldo&rsquo;s and the admiral
was clearly touched by it. When she had finished the story she
said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And, Admiral, our enemies are your enemies. The
men who are fighting us are warring you also. I do not ask you to take
my word for it, but I bring you a circular which is being distributed
over the island by Friar Lonzello, which I ask permission to read to
you.<span class="corr" id="xd21e546" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="par">The admiral gave his consent and the woman read,
translating from the Spanish as she proceeded:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">There appeared at dawn, on a sad day for this
country, my beloved sons, mastering our beautiful bay, the North
American squadron, that in a few months, and in spite of the heroism of
our sailors, destroyed our ships and raised upon one of our plazas,
blessed soil of the nation, the flag of the enemy. Do not ignore who it
is and what he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e554" href="#xd21e554"
name="xd21e554">24</a>]</span>attempts, who with such haughty pride,
would trample right under foot and impose himself upon us. It is the
alien, who wishes to subject us to his hard yoke. It is the heretic,
who desires to snatch from us our religion. It is the insatiable
commercialist, who, with the ruins of Spain and her possessions, wants
to swell his fortune. Unhappy Spain, if the invader achieves his
purpose! Poor Filipinos, the day that the North American establishes
here a permanent government! Very soon you will see an impassible
barrier between you and your proud masters. You would then have neither
office, employment nor participation in the government or
administration of the cities. You would soon form a separate class,
reviled as pariahs, exploited like miserable serfs, reduced to the
condition of day laborers, and even to that of a beast or a machine fed
with a pinch of rice or corn, that your master would throw in your face
as a daily ration, in order to not see himself deprived of the product
of your labor and sweat; he regaled with the treasures and fruits of
the country that is yours and not his. You would soon see your temples
in ruins. The cross would disappear from your cemeteries, the crucifix
from your schools.... Fortunately the Filipinos recognize all the
perils that threaten. Perhaps us a unit for your defense, and as a
single soul raise to heaven your ardent supplications. To arms, to
arms, and to prayer! To arms, for Spanish people, when its patriotism
is wounded and its religion attacked, is capable of great achievement.
To prayer, because the victory is with God and against infidels.</p>

<p class="par">Shortly afterward two boats put forth from the
battleship for the shore bearing, not only Mrs. Rizal, but also a
quantity of guns and ammunition, as well as other equipments for
campaigning. They were met at the shore by Saguanaldo and his men with
demonstrations of joy and Mrs. Rizal delivered her message from the
admiral with the feeling of triumph:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tell General Saguanaldo,&rdquo; the message went,

<h2 class="label">IV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">&ldquo;BY THE DAWN&rsquo;S EARLY LIGHT.&rdquo;</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was a dark night. The sports that had
characterized the early evening, and the throng of gay promenaders that
had ranged the streets devoted at night to the business of pleasure
instead of the pleasure of business, had given place to rest and quiet.
The city was asleep&mdash;soundly asleep. It was the sleep of
exhaustion that comes after play that is the hardest of work. Gambling
houses were closed. The cock-pit, where a few hours before so many had
gathered to participate in the great Spanish amusement, was deserted.
Even at the arsenal of <span class="corr" id="xd21e575" title=
"Source: CaVite">Cavite</span>, eight miles away, all was silent except
for the tread of sleepy sentinels.</p>
<p class="par">New Manila, a modern city of more than a hundred
thousand mixed people, lay on the east of Passig river, a place of
merchandising and cosmopolitan in its sport and games of chance. But,
though it was the more important of the two towns that were yet one, it
was within the walled city that the public buildings and the great
cathedral were located. Several stone bridges spanned the Passig river,
each opening to a gate in the wall, which was often 150 feet through,
but hollow, with rooms inside for the storage of forage, the stabling
of animals, etc. In olden days the wall was a formidable defense, and
was supplemented, where the river did not flow, with a moat. But now
the moat was neglected and covered with a green scum, and snakes
infested it while disease was breeded from it. And the wall was no
longer a defense. The soldiers were careless now. In truth, they were
poorly paid and none too loyal to Spain. It may have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e580" href="#xd21e580" name=
"xd21e580">26</a>]</span>been for this reason that at one of the gates,
this night, there was an opening that would admit a man, yet that was
not observable from a distance. For some strange reason no one seemed
to be watching. Dark figures filed into this gate, and crept under the
walls to the true gate, entering the city. A squad here, a few there,
but, all told, hundreds. Again, for some mysterious reason, no soldiers
were on guard. The city was safe anyhow; it had not been invaded for
many years, and the proud Castilian felt that no one would dare to
challenge him.</p>
<p class="par">Up unfrequented streets a few figures stole silently,
unobserved. It was so dark that, even had they been seen, few would
have known that they were armed. It was so silent that the city seemed
a place of the dead instead of the living, and the superstitious
natives who were thus stealing into the city were more apprehensive of
apparitions than of the Spanish soldiery. As the men entered from many
streets they converged to one place. They then moved in small squads
silently on the sentries, capturing and silencing them. They moved to
the public buildings and took possession of them. They ran down the
Spanish flag and in its place hoisted the insurgent flag. It was the
crowning work of Saguanaldo.</p>
<p class="par">Before this time, under his leadership, the insurgents
had taken possession of Malalos, and even now they were active all over
the island of Luzon. An election was under consideration, and
Saguanaldo&rsquo;s candidacy for president was uncontested. It was a
peculiar situation, due to a lull before the storm. The American fleet,
after having sunk the Spanish vessels, hesitated about taking
possession of the islands lest complications might ensue; yet it was
such a menace to the Spanish forts that they realized their
helplessness. With both the Spaniards and Americans doing nothing, the
insurgents <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e586" href="#xd21e586"
name="xd21e586">27</a>]</span>were able to accomplish more than they
had ever done before. Their success filled Saguanaldo with delight. He
arranged his troops to the best advantage and was soon in possession of
the city.</p>
<p class="par">Then suddenly the stars winked out and over the wooded
uplands to the east the sun arose.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is the sun of Filipino independence,&rdquo;
said Saguanaldo, pointing to the orb of day. &ldquo;How quickly has the
darkness passed and how bright the new era of the Philippines
is.&rdquo; And then the soldiers cheered.</p>
<p class="par">When morning come and the people understood the changed
situation Mrs. Rizal called on Ambrosia Lonzello that she might
felicitate with her. &ldquo;Ambrosia, the city has been taken and is in
the hands of the insurgents,&rdquo; began the older woman. &ldquo;It
means Filipino freedom. Even if we are not able to maintain our own
independence, then America will be our protector. And the night is
past. Oh, thank God, thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Dr. Rizal has won, in his wife,&rdquo; replied
the younger woman. &ldquo;I think he must rejoice, together with all
the thousands who through the centuries have given their lives for
Filipino freedom. It must be a happy day in heaven as well as earth.
Even the sun seems glad and all nature rejoices this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For the first time since my husband suffered so
cruelly and unjustly I am happy,&rdquo; responded the older woman.
&ldquo;You will wed Saguanaldo and you will be happy with him. You will
not have to see him shot in disgrace, Ambrosia, but instead will be
hailed as the wife of the liberator. But think not that I envy you or
grumble at my fate. It is enough for me that I have realized the dream
my husband dreamed and helped to do his work.&rdquo; <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first"><span class="corr" id="xd21e605" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Where is Ambrosia?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Bishop Lonzello addressed the woman who had borne a
daughter to him in the home he had provided for her. He was deeply
agitated with passion. The insurgents, who had elected a president and
assembly, had already nationalized the friars&rsquo; lands, and the
heresy of Aglipay was waxing formidable, having possession of most of
the churches throughout Luzon. Lonzello had heard that his daughter
Ambrosia had been receiving attentions from Saguanaldo, the leader of
the insurgents, and the thought of it made him furious. It showed in
his face as he stood before the woman he had once loved and whom now he
supported.</p>
<p class="par">She was deeply religious. To her, submission to the
embrace of Friar Lonzello had been obedience to God&rsquo;s messenger,
and to this day she regarded him as a sinless representative of Deity
rather than as husband. It had been many weeks since Bishop Lonzello
had deigned to visit her. There were other and younger women whom he
met now; still, he made no attempt to conceal the parentage of the
girl, and the general knowledge that he was her father had no bearing
on his standing either as a citizen or a priest.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I do not know, Holy Father,&rdquo; replied the
Filipino woman meekly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You ought to know. What do you suppose will
become of your daughter if you let her wander about apart from your
knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nothing bad, I hope. I have great faith in
Ambrosia.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e618" href=
"#xd21e618" name="xd21e618">29</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nothing bad! <i>Diablo!</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e623src" href="#xd21e623" name="xd21e623src">1</a> Something has
happened to her. Ambrosia has disgraced us and blasphemed the God of
her fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Holy Father, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I mean that the girl has gone astray, and you
have not prevented her.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It apparently did not occur to him that both father and
mother had aforetime gone astray, and that it hardly behooved them to
talk of lapses of their daughter while making religious professions
themselves. But the mother only turned pale and gasped.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I do not see how it can be. Tell me what you
mean, Holy Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ambrosia has been meeting Saguanaldo, the enemy
of his country and of religion&mdash;meeting him in secret and at
night. I will not say that she has fallen from virtue, for that is not
so bad as lapsing from her God and her duty. Fornication might be
forgiven, but the sin against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness.
Woman, these meetings must cease. You hear me; they must
cease.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The woman trembled and mumbled. Her eyes fell as she
replied:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I will do my best, Holy Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do your best! Damnation! Am I to be told that you
will do your best? I tell you your daughter is the enemy of God, and
you will only do your best to stop her. Do your best, <i>Diablo!</i>
Forbid her leaving the house; keep her in prison; put her in a convent.
This thing must stop. Woman, do you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The mother faltered, and crossed herself. Apparently she
was willing, but had not the strength of character to enforce her
will.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You speak to her, Holy Father,&rdquo; she spoke
hardly above <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e652" href="#xd21e652"
name="xd21e652">30</a>]</span>a whisper. But the irate priest turned
away with an imperious gesture. As he turned Ambrosia herself entered
from a side door and now confronted him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i lang="es">Sin-verguenza!</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd21e658src" href="#xd21e658" name="xd21e658src">2</a>&rdquo; he
hissed.</p>
<p class="par">The girl straightened in dignity. &ldquo;I do not permit
even my father to say that to me,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And I do not permit a daughter of mine to consort
with a heretic and rebel.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The priest faced her with a sneer, and anger that shook
his frame, while his fingers clasped and unclasped themselves. He
looked ready to clutch her by the throat.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I owe you nothing as a father,&rdquo; the young
girl replied quietly but bravely, &ldquo;since you did not give me even
a name when you gave me life. I owe you nothing as a mediator between
God and man, because your life and words have not convinced me that you
have the ear of God. But I am as much above your accusations as I am
above your habits.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The bishop lifted his hand and struck at her. She was
young and lithe, and avoided the blow. He picked up a stone and threw
at her, yet again she slipped away. Then he remembered himself, and,
raising his hand, began the formal curse of the church. The girl
listened with form erect and with a smile of defiance on her lips; but
the mother fell on her knees and as the anathemas poured in anger from
the lips of the father upon the child, she who believed they would come
to pass, fell on the ground, and, writhing in agony before him, begged
him to desist. But it was all in vain.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The eye that mocketh at her father, and despiseth
to obey her mother, the ravens of the valley shall pluck it out, and
the young vultures shall eat it,&rdquo; the priest hissed; the mother
groaned.</p>
<p class="par">The priest straightened, and, pointing his finger at his
daughter, continued: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e678" href=
"#xd21e678" name="xd21e678">31</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Cursed shall thou be in the city and cursed shall
thou be in the field. Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store. Cursed
shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy land, the increase
of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep. Cursed shall thou be when
thou comest in and cursed shall thou be when thou goest out. The Lord
shall send upon thee cursing, vexation and rebuke in all that thou
settest thy hand for to do, until thou be destroyed and until thou
perish quickly, because of the wickedness of thy doing whereby thou
hast forsaken me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The mother lay with her face on the ground in a swoon as
he concluded. The priest walked away, and the eyes of the girl, his
daughter, followed him with fearless look.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You have cursed me with life,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You have cursed me before this, so that I can not even love as
others do. That is the end of your power.&rdquo; <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Foolish, foolish, foolish!&rdquo; Mrs.
Rizal was expressing her opinion of General Saguanaldo&rsquo;s action
to the insurgent general himself.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i>Caspita!</i> Why is it foolish?&rdquo; asked
the general.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Because you may offend America, without the
friendship of which you can not win. It will be natural for the United
States, after having captured the Philippines in the prosecution of a
foreign war, to want to hold on to them. And if America chooses to hold
the islands and make them part of the United States in declaring the
independence of the Philippines you will only turn America from your
side to oppose you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you suppose I want to fight side by side with
America for freedom from Spain and then be subjected to that country?
Did you not tell me that Admiral Rainey promised us
independence?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No. He could not promise us independence, because
he is not the sovereign of America. The most he did, the most he could
do, was to promise to aid us in our fight with the Spaniards, and he
could do that only because his country, too, is at war with
Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then what advantage will it be to us to win,
seeing that, though we may win from Spain, we will lose to America?
<i lang="es">Por Dios, <span class="corr" id="xd21e708" title=
"Source: Senora">Se&ntilde;ora</span>!</i> what do you expect of
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You may not win independence, but you may win
freedom and justice. You can not win independence, anyhow. It is
doubtful if foreign countries would recognize the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e714" href="#xd21e714" name=
"xd21e714">33</a>]</span>Filipino republic, even if America should
depart and leave us to work out our own salvation. It is also doubtful
if we could win without America&rsquo;s help. Our hope is in securing
the aid of the republic that is giving Cuba her liberty, and repay the
freedom that is possible of attainment at this time and at no
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Independence is all that will suit me. I have not
such a low conception of good for the Filipinos as you seem to
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Filipino impatiently and angrily entered his
headquarters.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Rizal went away, sad at heart.</p>
<p class="par">After Saguanaldo had secured the city of Manila he had
occupied the public buildings, and a provisional government had been
organized. The Filipino assembly at Malalos had adopted a constitution
for the Filipino republic fondly hoping that the Americans would ratify
it. Admiral Rainey had offered no objection; but it can not be said
that he had advised the move. Indeed, he was merely awaiting
instruction from America; and yet the presence of his fleet was the
wholesome reminder that gave the provisional government power to
maintain itself. Saguanaldo had been elected president and duly
installed in office. The provisional government, among its first acts,
had declared the friar lands confiscated and nationalized; and, while
nothing had been done to enforce the new law, yet it was a fact that
native priests, representing the schismatic Filipino Catholic church,
had secured possession of the larger number of the churches and
religious buildings throughout Luzon. This was not to be wondered at,
because there were nearly three million who were in rebellion against
the foreign priests, and less than half that number who were yet loyal
to them. It was in Manila alone that the friars were in undisputed
control. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e725" href="#xd21e725" name=
"xd21e725">34</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Perhaps power may have turned the head of Saguanaldo.
Mrs. Rizal had told him that desire for honors had tempted him beyond
the pale of discretion. It might have been better had he organized a
provisional government and made it subject to the United States, since,
then, it might have been recognized and maintained by the new invading
power. But Saguanaldo denied personal ambition, and with some truth. He
had planned to make the day of the declaration of national
independence, which he had proclaimed, as the occasion of his marriage
with Ambrosia Lonzello, and had craved, as a young bridegroom, to show
her the honor, on that occasion, of having her hailed as the
president&rsquo;s wife, so that it was for her sake more than his own
he sought the honor. So often this is true. Men seek wealth and place,
not so much for themselves as that they may please and impress a
woman.</p>
<p class="par">But things did not seem to be going right. Not only was
Mrs. Rizal offended at his action, but when he, with a lover&rsquo;s
ardor and enthusiasm, had laid the matter before Ambrosia Lonzello, she
had responded with tears.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You do not love me,&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Better than life, Camillo,&rdquo; responded the
girl. &ldquo;But my heart tells me that all is not well. You may
declare independence, but you will not have it until you first fight
for it. I understand you are eager to give me honors, and I appreciate
the motive, but I can not marry you and become a burden to you until
the bitter battle and hard struggle are past.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That proves you do not love me,&rdquo; iterated
the youth, sulkily.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I shall prove to you I do love you by waiting for
you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e738" href="#xd21e738" name=
"xd21e738">35</a>]</span>until your work is done, and then I shall
marry you just as freely and just as proudly, <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e740" title="Source: through">though</span> you are defeated and
without honor, as if you are successful and undisputedly president of
the Filipino republic. It is the desire to do great and right things,
the effort to do them, that makes the soul great, whether the deeds be
really done or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But what pleasure will there be for me in the
ceremonies of inauguration if you be not by my side?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If it was merely to give you pleasure, Camillo,
if it was merely to gratify my pride or my selfish desire, I would
become your bride on the day set for the celebration of Filipino
independence. But I must decline to marry you now for your sake and for
the sake of Filipino independence. You shall need to be free from ties
of home and responsibility to me. Unless you are free I do not think
you can win. Therefore, I refuse to hang around your neck in the
battle, lest in doing so I cause you to be defeated.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The insurgent general plead, but in vain. Then he left,
hurt and blaming her.</p>
<p class="par">The day for inauguration and celebration approached, and
where he had expected the triumph of his life he faced defeat; where he
had expected exultation and bliss he was filled with disappointment and
bitterness. Still, preparations for the ceremonial proceeded. The day
dawned at last. General Saguanaldo was present as the central figure,
and was received with cheers as the savior of his country. But neither
Mrs. Rizal or Ambrosia Lonzello were present. The people were merry
with feasting and noise, and the enemies did not show themselves. The
ceremonies of inauguration of the first Filipino president proceeded
without interruption, and Saguanaldo made an inaugural address that was
favorably received. Yet to him it was a disappointment, because
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e752" href="#xd21e752" name=
"xd21e752">36</a>]</span>the One was not there amid the thousands. It
is always the One we care for. The applause we crave is as nothing
except the One applaud. The attainment we secure is mediocrity unless
the One see us advanced and glories in our deed. And when, instead of
the applause of the One, the approval and sympathy of the One, the One
turns away with disapproval, then we feel the deed were better not
done, and the applause is a mockery. So the day was not a triumph to
Saguanaldo. Even when the shades of evening fell, and the people
brought forth the fireworks, when Manila was noisy with explosives and
when she was gay with rejoicing and sportive people, Saguanaldo&rsquo;s
heart was like lead, and he was bitter against the two who were the
most loyal to him of all others.</p>
<p class="par">Yet there seemed to be no reason for the heaviness of
his heart. Perfect weather, a program without a hitch, expressions of
good will only, without a word or act of disapproval from the enemies
of the republic, it seemed that Saguanaldo ought to have been happy. He
was making history as his friends told him. He would hereafter be
hailed as the liberator of the Filipinos. The day would be celebrated
for years as the day of rejoicing, the greatest in Filipino history.
Why could he not shake off the dread apprehension that lay like lead on
his heart? Is there such a thing as premonition, which tells one things
to come, when he is too hard of hearing to receive the message?</p>
<p class="par">But Saguanaldo got through the day. As night came he was
wearied, exhausted from sorrow. But with the weariness peace came to
him. It is the ease that comes when nature would heal a wound.
Saguanaldo thought it meant success for him. He would triumph anyhow,
and then they would believe in him. It was the fate of the great to be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e758" href="#xd21e758" name=
"xd21e758">37</a>]</span>misunderstood and derided by their friends,
and he must greatly bear if he would triumph greatly.</p>
<p class="par">At last the last fireworks had been exploded, the last
hurrahs expressed, and in the deep silence and serenity of the night
Saguanaldo lay to rest, feeling that, after all, it was not a failure;
and, being tired, he slept. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e762"

<h2 class="label">VII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">SUBJECTED BY WORDS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was late when Saguanaldo awakened the following
morning. He had no more than opened the casement blinds and stepped out
on the veranda than he saw that the city was unusually stirred. He went
into the streets to make inquiry.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The American army has arrived and is
disembarking,&rdquo; was the word he received.</p>
<p class="par">He walked into the heart of the city, and saw regiments
of soldiers wearing the new khaki uniform, marching through the
streets. His heart sank within him at the sight, and the warning Mrs.
Rizal had given him recurred to his mind. Against these soldiers he
knew he could do nothing, and if he should seek to maintain the
Filipino independence that had been proclaimed the day previous, with
hostile Spaniards on the one side and hostile Americans on the other,
he saw at once that the case was hopeless. Yet, to give up his
ambition, to forego independence for the Filipinos, to abandon the hope
of making Ambrosia Lonzello his wife and the first lady of Luzon, to
yield his new title and new honors without at least a show of
resistance, was more than he felt like doing. He was perturbed, his
mind flying from one resolve to another and his heart filled with one
emotion after another. &ldquo;And while he mused the fire
burned.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Camillo, the people are depending on their
president to do something for them in this crisis. Do you feel you can
gather your troops together and successfully resist the
Americans?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It was Mrs. Rizal speaking. She was standing by his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e778" href="#xd21e778" name=
"xd21e778">39</a>]</span>side. There was no trace of exultation in her
voice, but she spoke in deeply sympathetic tones.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What would you advise?&rdquo; asked the insurgent
general, meekly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Go as the accredited leader of the Filipino
people and welcome at the landing the general who comes from America.
It will put America on your side, and that means against the
Spaniards.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Saguanaldo considered. &ldquo;I will do it,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p class="par">Indecision had left him. A few moments afterward,
accompanied by his staff, and wearing his smartest uniform and
<span class="corr" id="xd21e788" title=
"Source: acouterment">accoutrement</span>, he was driven to the pier,
where he asked to be conveyed to the American general. His rank was at
once recognized and he was taken to the commander in charge, being
received by him with marked civility, and consulted relative to the
placing of the American troops. Cordial relations seemed to be
established between the two leaders at once; and Saguanaldo was very
much gratified, after the noon hour, to receive from Judge Benjamin
Daft, the man who had been sent from America to serve as civil governor
of the Philippines, an invitation to visit him on shipboard.</p>
<p class="par">Judge Daft was found to be a large man with a happy
smile, who was very cordial in his manner. Within a very few minutes
after they met Saguanaldo was smoking with him and felt at perfect
ease.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Judge Daft, &ldquo;that
it is somewhat embarrassing for you, as well as for me, that I come
with orders to supercede you as governor of the Philippines. But you
understand that the war is not yet over, and the final termination of
things is not yet determined on. I want to assure you, however, that
the United States desires only the welfare of the Filipinos. I believe
it would be better for us <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e796" href=
"#xd21e796" name="xd21e796">40</a>]</span>to co-operate and make sure
of victory than to quarrel and possibly defeat the good that both
desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i lang="es">Vd. disponza!</i> All I want,&rdquo;
said Saguanaldo meekly, &ldquo;is not to be humiliated.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I feel that as a representative of the American
republic I can guarantee you that. You can be of invaluable service in
the field in quelling disorder and bringing opportunity to your
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am not insensible to the fact that you, as
representative of a great republic with standing already before the
world, can command greater respect than I could do as president of the
untried Filipino republic.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A very sensible view to take of it. I am very
much pleased to find so liberal and disinterested a man as you at the
head of affairs. It speaks well both for the Filipino people and for
the cause you represent. The American republic will remember such
unselfish sentiments, and I am sure you will not lose by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">General Saguanaldo was flattered by these remarks. They
made him desire to appear oven more disinterested. He began:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My chief concern is for the Filipinos. You can
scarcely be ignorant of the injustice we have borne for centuries. We
want freedom and opportunity. I ask these things for the
Filipinos.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The request does you honor, and it will do
America honor to grant them. Between us all we shall be invincible.
With the prestige of the American republic behind us we can command the
good will of the nations. Rainey&rsquo;s fleet will be able to keep
<span class="corr" id="xd21e815" title="Source: CaVite">Cavite</span>
in subjection. The American general is an old campaigner who has with
him a seasoned army and the best of equipment, so that he will be able
to stand before any army that Spain can muster against him. Lastly, and
most important of all, you, General, are familiar with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e818" href="#xd21e818" name=
"xd21e818">41</a>]</span>islands of the Philippines, and can render
service as a guide and leader such as no other man on the earth can
give; and in serving us you will be serving yourself and the cause of
Filipino liberty. I have heard much of the Fox of Luzon, and have felt
that if I could formulate a plan that would enable us all to work
together harmoniously, it would be a victory second only to the great
victory that Admiral Rainey won in this beautiful bay of
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I will do all I can, Judge Daft. As you have
said, together we shall be invincible.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In that case I shall feel no hesitancy about
landing. I did think that perhaps it was not a courteous thing to do,
to come from across the great ocean to your shores and then ask you to
take me in as something more than guest. But in war we can not stand on
ceremony. Your disinterestedness and your courtesy have been so great
that you have made it much easier for me to do my duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The two men wandered over the ship, Judge Daft showing
Saguanaldo all the wonders of the modern man of war. They discussed
various matters apart from the questions most in their minds, and
always Judge Daft was courteous and apparently keenly appreciative of
Saguanaldo. Following the visit of Saguanaldo to the battleship, Judge
Daft visited him in the public building of Manila, and, with his
permission, the American flag was run up over the town in place of the
flag of the new republic. Within two days Saguanaldo went into the
interior as the guide rather than the commander of an expedition which
the American general sent against some Spanish troops that had, under
the direction of Bishop Lonzello, been preparing to attack Saguanaldo
in Manila, but that, after the Americans landed, had retired into the
interior.</p>
<p class="par">It was only after they had gotten into the interior that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e829" href="#xd21e829" name=
"xd21e829">42</a>]</span>Saguanaldo began to realize his position. It
came to him that, though he had been hailed as president of the
Filipino republic, another occupied his capital, and the Filipino
republic was at an end; though he had been the leader of an
insurrection, the insurrection was inoperative; and he was fighting
under another power; though he had celebrated the independence of the
Filipinos, Filipino independence was gone, and he was seeking to
subject the people to another foreign nation. While he was under the
spell of Judge Daft&rsquo;s influence, he had not noticed it, but now
it came to him with all its meaning and bearing all its bitterness. He
felt that he had lost. He felt that he was not only unable to cope
against the arms and warships of this strange republic from across the
seas, but he was also unable to meet their wiles&mdash;diplomacy, they
called it. He had heard the word used and now he was beginning to
understand what it really meant.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am a fool,&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;Ambrosia knows it, and so she despises me. But if I must be
beaten I will show her that at least I am no coward.&rdquo; It was
heroism surviving folly.</p>
<p class="par">So ever it is the one who influences human actions,
whether they be good or bad, public or private, in nature. <span class=

<h2 class="label">VIII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE MIGHTY DIPLOMAT.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The day following the departure of the allied
troops from Manila an English ship steamed into Manila bay, and among
those who landed was a Jesuit, who came as papal nuncio, a special
envoy of the pope, the astute Leo XIII. He at once hunted up Bishop
Lonzello and was soon closeted with him over wine and cigars,
discussing the situation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You see yourself the Spaniards cannot stand
before the Americans. They represent the old order, the Americans the
new; the old must pass. It is more than useless, it is folly, to stay
with the passing policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But the Spaniards are friends of the church and
the Americans are its enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I fear you are short-sighted, Brother Lonzello.
The Americans are to be Catholics, while the Spaniards have only been
Catholics. A live dog is better than a dead lion. But the Americans are
not to be despised. The republic is entering on world politics, and if
the Holy Father could control that nation he would as good as control
the world through it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But he can never control that nation; it is given
to heresy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I do not agree with you. Neither does the Holy
Father at Rome. Remember, I am speaking for him. Already we have two
million voters in America. United, that means the balance of power. It
is something that any candidate may well covet. But that is not all. As
a result of this war America will add the Philippines to her territory,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e853" href="#xd21e853" name=
"xd21e853">44</a>]</span>with possibly Cuba and Porto Rico besides. In
time, states will be formed of these territories, and they, being
almost wholly Catholic, will give America to the true religion. It is
something worth working for, and the prospect makes the Holy Father
eager that you should fall in with his plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it possible to make America
Catholic.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The apostolic nuncio puffed his cigar in silence a
moment. Then he leaned forward and said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Suppose we induce the capitalists of America to
import a million Italians to be naturalized. Suppose we secure jobs for
a million Mexicans in America and see that they are naturalized.
Suppose that finally Central America and Mexico are annexed to the
United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why, that is treason to the Latin and the Spanish
races.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No. It is taking advantage of new conditions.
America is developed to the point where it is necessary that she should
expand. If she should dig the Panama canal, it will be natural for her
to close in on territory that divides her, and excuses are more easily
found than grapes in a vineyard. It will aid rather than hinder the
Catholic. American capitalists can pay higher wages than either the
Italians or Mexicans receive and still obtain them cheaper than they
get labor today. Catholic workmen will merely supercede heretics. If
Mexico is taken there will be a leveling up as well as a leveling down,
and the peon will gain immensely by the change.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But it means an entire change of
policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The old policy has been worked to the end, and a
new one is necessary. We are living in an age of machinery. Peon and
slave can no longer yield the returns that the hireling can do by the
aid of machinery. The returns from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e870" href="#xd21e870" name="xd21e870">45</a>]</span>Philippines
can be quadrupled; and we were foolish to forego the rich harvest
because it involves a change of tenants.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The friar was flushed and angry. He almost shouted.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But that means that the Spanish friars are to
lose power in the Philippines. Do you realize what you are asking us to
forego?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Perfectly. You have had your opportunity and have
made a failure of it. The natives have been rebelling against you for
three hundred years. Now, Aglipay has stirred a schism that has taken
from Rome a majority of our churches. So long as the Spanish friars
remain in power the dissatisfaction will increase rather than diminish.
It seems providential that America should come at this time, for it
gives the supreme pontiff an opportunity to transfer you and by
diplomacy save the work you have done for the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The friar sank back in his chair and thought. Then he
mildly said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is a hard thing you ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, but your order asked the same thing once of
the Jesuits, and, on order of the Pope, we were expelled from the
Philippines for many years. Now the supreme pontiff is merely
exercising his right of transfer relative to the three orders of friars
in the Philippines. It is his voice, and you will not dare disobey
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I suppose, of course, we shall have to submit.
But it is hard. Shall we have to lose our property, our
lands?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I come with a mission to the Americans relative
to them. I have not talked with the Americans yet, but I can assure you
justice. As for the churches and convents, you have lost them to the
church, and it is part of my mission to regain them for the
church.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I shall have to submit. But I can not overcome my
hatred of the Americans and I will not remain to knuckle <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e891" href="#xd21e891" name=
"xd21e891">46</a>]</span>to the natives. I wish I might strike them one
hard blow.&rdquo; He brought his fist down on the table with a thump.
The Jesuit was silent a moment. Then he said: &ldquo;The Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away. You know the response.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The lands which the supreme pontiff gave to
Legaspi he may take again from the heirs of Legaspi.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I can not for the life of me see where the holy
church will profit from the change, seeing that Spain is a Catholic
country and America is heretic.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Spain will remain true to the church even if she
loses. But if America wins, then we may not only win back into the fold
the schismatics of the islands, but stand also a chance of winning
America, and with it the world. It is the greatest, opportunity the
church has had for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I do not yet see how you expect to win
America.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We have been working for the conquest of America
for centuries, ever since Columbus gave it to the world and dedicated
it to Christ and his <span class="corr" id="xd21e903" title=
"Source: vicegerent">viceregent</span>. After the heretics had taken
possession of it, we have labored without cessation to win it back. We
brought believing emigrants to the cities until we control many of
them. We now have ten million population and two million voters,
controlling several states and holding the balance of political power.
Already the politicians are taking cognizance of us, But, more
important than this, the statesmen are looking for a power that can
withstand the tide of Socialism that is sweeping over the land and are
ready to make concessions to us for our influence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The most far-seeing of American politicians
recently remarked that some day Socialism would become a menace to the
world and that the strongest influence to combat it would be the Roman
Catholic church. Acting on this belief he has already been negotiating
for our support. It was the Catholic <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e908" href="#xd21e908" name="xd21e908">47</a>]</span>vote that
saved America from the domination of the middle class when threatened
by the mob in 1896. It was members of my order who fanned the flame
that led to the present war, so that America might enter on world
politics. The end is not yet. The Pope sees the importance of our
plans, and you must submit. We intend that in the future it shall be
known that he who would succeed at the polls must have our favor. We
have the power now, and we shall use it. The Brotherhood of Jesus has
been banished from almost every country on the face of the globe, but
in spite of this we have remained loyal to our extreme oath, and have
not for a moment faltered in our purpose to make America Catholic. We
are now at the point of success, and the supreme pontiff sends me to
command you to yield. Is your loyalty sufficient for that? Remember, we
have been driven from land after land, and show yourself as true as the
Jesuits have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Bishop Lonzello did not reply. But he filled the two
glasses, and as he raised his glass to his lips he proposed the
toast:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Leo, the greatest of Popes. When he speaks it is
time for the rest of the world to be silent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">After the toast had been drunk the Jesuit father
referred no more to the topic about which he had been talking. They
were sitting by the window looking out on the street where quite a few
people were promenading. As one woman after another passed they
discussed the good points of each and waxed merry over the wine,
rehearsing many salacious stories. Finally Ambrosia Lonzello passed.
The Jesuit, looking on her, remarked:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That is the woman for me. She has the
woman&rsquo;s ten perfect points. Do you know her, Brother?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e919" href="#xd21e919" name=
"xd21e919">48</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The bishop&rsquo;s lips were dry and his heart was
enraged as he answered, feebly, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you give me opportunity to hear her
confession?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The bishop knew what was implied by the request, and his
heart was fired with the heat of his passion. He made a motion once to
kick the Jesuit down stairs. But the knowledge that he was a special
envoy of the Pope, and, more than that, the counter-fire of anger at
Ambrosia, and the fierce flame of his hatred of Saguanaldo, caused him
to desist. Indeed, the first flames had eaten so deeply into his heart
that there was little left for the flame caused by the insult to touch.
He merely answered, quietly, after swallowing a little:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That is the sweetheart of the insurgent general,
Saguanaldo.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, that is good,&rdquo; responded the Jesuit.
&ldquo;You hate him and would like to wound him to the death before you
go. Behold, the Lord hath delivered him into your hands. Promise me
that the girl shall confess to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He seized the bishop&rsquo;s arm and leered lewdly at
him. &ldquo;You really must, for I am mad from continence while on the
water. Some day I will do as much for you. Won&rsquo;t you, good
Bishop?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Bishop Lonzello clenched his fist and hissed through his
teeth, &ldquo;Yes; and may God damn your soul to hell.&rdquo;

<p class="par first">&ldquo;I am very glad to meet you as a citizen,
but of course it is against the policy of my country to receive you as
an envoy from the Pope.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Very well, Judge Daft, we shall not quarrel over
a little thing like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It was the Jesuit talking to the new American governor.
He had no intention of abandoning his purpose, but he meant to approach
it by indirection. He knew something of diplomacy himself, and so
devoted a few minutes to casual conversation. He was by nature and
practice an expert in the recounting of stories, having found that an
art which won where no other art was honored, and the two passed a
pleasant half hour together. Finally, as Rodriguez Violeta, the Jesuit
father, arose to take his departure, he said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If I speak purely as an individual, I presume you
will not object to my <span class="corr" id="xd21e948" title=
"Source: aking">asking</span> that you treat us fairly relative to
churches and church lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;By no means. I have no objection to telling you
that I desire to treat you fairly in these and all other
matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Perhaps you would not object, then, to issuing an
order that, until the matter can be settled in the courts, the
possession of churches is to be secured to the party in possession,
whether that party be the Roman Catholic church or the Filipino
Catholic church. This seems to me to be fair, and I believe is in
accordance with American jurisprudence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I shall be glad to issue an order of that nature
to the soldiers in the Philippines. Anything that is mutually just
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e957" href="#xd21e957" name=
"xd21e957">50</a>]</span>will be granted you; and, while I can not
receive you as envoy of the Pope, I shall take pleasure in hearing your
recommendations as an individual of experience who is capable of
understanding your people and presenting your side of the controversy
in a fair and liberal way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If I can be of any service to you, it will afford
me pleasure to be commanded by you. I do believe, however, that the
holy father, the Pope, has a plan which would save you very much
trouble. I wish you would permit me to present it&mdash;as an
individual.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are at perfect liberty to do that. Be seated
and I will hear you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Jesuit <span class="corr" id="xd21e966" title=
"Source: reseated">re-seated</span> himself. The camel&rsquo;s nose had
found entrance, and the rest of the body was about to follow.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Spanish friars are at the bottom of all the
trouble in the Philippines. The Aglipayan schism came <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e971" title="Source: became">because</span> of them, and
the many revolts that have disturbed the islands for the past three
centuries have been because the people wanted native rather than
Spanish priests. Now Leo, who has always been friendly to America and
Americans, is desirous of removing the Spanish friars from the
Philippines.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Judge Daft leaned forward, evidently interested.
&ldquo;This concerns me greatly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Outline to me
the plan more fully.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Jesuit ignored the request. Instead of answering him
directly, he observed: &ldquo;This would greatly simplify matters and
make your problem sensibly easier of solution.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am conscious of that,&rdquo; asserted the
Judge, betraying eagerness, a weakness which revealed that he was being
beaten in diplomacy.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;America can easily handle the Spanish army. Your
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e982" href="#xd21e982" name=
"xd21e982">51</a>]</span>future problems will lie with pacifying the
natives and adjudicating the conflicting claim of the two
churches.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You understand the situation just as it presents
itself to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You have splendid opportunities here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You mean, to make a fool of myself?&rdquo;
laughed Judge Daft.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That is an opportunity that knocks often at every
man&rsquo;s door. But I was not thinking of that. I was merely
musing&mdash;speaking aloud the thing I thought&mdash;and a man never
ought to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sometimes I think he never ought to speak aloud
anything else than his undisguised thoughts. I shall insist on hearing
this novel thing, the undisguised thought of a Jesuit.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I meant, opportunity to make yourself a
reputation that shall lead to future political power. Who knows but
that the presidency of the United States lies along this
path?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am not ambitious.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I understand that; indeed, I was not thinking so
much of you as an individual as of you in your position. I was musing,
you know. We Jesuits naturally look into the political possibilities of
things, and I am astonished at the possibilities I see before
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;War generally brings a warrior to the front. The
people take pleasure in preferring their military heroes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That is very true. I perceive you are an astute
politician. Because you are so far-sighted, you cannot fail to realize
that if you are enabled to satisfactorily settle a dispute that has
been raging for three centuries, and give America the Philippines to
exploit, you will have distinguished yourself in a way that is sure to
bring reward. Perhaps not at once. The military hero may come first,
while your reputation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1005" href=
"#xd21e1005" name="xd21e1005">52</a>]</span>is in process of building;
but if you succeed, your time will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The people are very forgetful.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But men of affairs are not, and they are the
folks who count. The substantial business men, who see the advantages
that accrue to them because of these things, will remember; and the
holy church never forgets. We alone poll two million votes in America
now. But, remember, I am only musing. I am asking nothing. I shall
report, however, the kindness you have shown me, which will, I feel
sure, help to make your task easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For your suggestions I thank you. You shall be
welcome whenever you choose to call&mdash;in your individual
capacity.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are a sly dog, Judge. I confess myself
completely out-generaled in diplomacy, and have dropped it. Hereafter I
wish to be known only as your friend. In the language of the Spaniards,
<i lang="es">buenas noches, amizo mio</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Never more of a diplomat than when he was claiming to
have abandoned diplomacy, the priest took his departure, knowing that
he had left thoughts that would cling and bear fruit. He understood
that, though the Judge might have been able to handle the simple-minded
Saguanaldo by his diplomacy, every good has its better and he had been
bested without realizing it. It is the true test of wit that cuts so
smoothly one does not know of his wound at the time <span class="corr"
id="xd21e1020" title="Source: its">it</span> is given.</p>
<p class="par">The Jesuit sought Bishop Lonzello and spoke imperiously
and exultantly:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am to have an order from the American governor
that the soldiers are to protect in possession either side of the
controversy that may have possession of churches and convents. You want
to summon all you can command and seize at night <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1028" href="#xd21e1028" name=
"xd21e1028">53</a>]</span>on all these buildings that you can. You
haven&rsquo;t half of them now, and by this means you may secure
practically all of them. And the American army is pledged to maintain
you in possession of them, once you are in charge. There is no time for
delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Lonzello was not a man who needed to have explained to
him the advantage this gave the friars. He sprang up, before the Jesuit
was through speaking, and began preparing to go on the street and set
his machinery in motion.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You will not find me sleeping,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p class="par">The Jesuit leered: &ldquo;Am I to confess that young
woman as my reward?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Lonzello opened the door and showed him from the room,
kicking at him as he passed. Once the Jesuit was outside, however, he
said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I will send the girl to the cathedral at ten
o&rsquo;clock tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then he closed the door. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Ambrosia&rsquo;s mother had again received a visit
from Bishop Lonzello. This time he had insisted that his daughter
confess in order that she might be forgiven and the curse pronounced
against her rendered null. It is possible that the bishop himself
believed that the curse held power. Certain it is that the woman feared
it and had wept almost constantly since that day that it had been
pronounced on Ambrosia. Now she fell in with the idea of Ambrosia
confessing and securing release from the curse. She brought the matter
before her daughter, who demurred. Then she urged it with such
insistence, declaring that filial duty required some reparation on her
part, that Ambrosia was touched, and, at the same time, being plagued
by the importunity of her mother, consented to confess, and even to
confess before the foreign friar, in the church against which she was
in rebellion. Indeed, she preferred the foreigner to one of the priests
who had long resided in the islands and fallen with its ways.</p>
<p class="par">Behold, then, Ambrosia Lonzello at the cathedral before
the confessional in which Violeta was seated. She did not know it, but
the moment she entered the confessional the door had been locked behind
her by an attendant, at the signal from the officiating priest.</p>
<p class="par">Ambrosia knelt at the confessional, troubled in heart.
She felt out of place in a church against which she was in rebellion;
and, while feeling that she ought to atone for disrespect shown a
father, still she knew not what to say. She <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1054" href="#xd21e1054" name=
"xd21e1054">55</a>]</span>knelt in prayer, and as she prayed, the
priest within the cell gazed upon her with lustful eyes, studying her
points as a sportsman might study the creature he meant to kill and
devour. As he looked, the appetite for sex, the fiercest passion that
sways mankind, took possession of and began to rage within him. Finally
he spoke:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Daughter, have you been guilty of disloyalty to
the holy church? Have you consorted with those who are the enemies of
the religion and of their country?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Naturally, the question, so unexpected, disconcerted the
girl kneeling before the cell with her eyes so downcast that she did
not see the priest within the cell. Various emotions surged within her.
Her first impulse was to deny rebellion to true religion and rush from
the church. But she concluded that it were best to remain and admit the
thing that had caused her mother sorrow. So she confessed:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have met the general of the insurrectionists
and am his friend. But I am not an enemy of the true
religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you met him at night?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The girl, although, knowing it compromised her, said
softly, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Late at night or early in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Again she faltered as she replied,
&ldquo;Both.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Were you two alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Did he employ embraces or kisses toward
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Still lower, hardly above a whisper, &ldquo;Yes; but we
are engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Did he caress you, feeling over your person with
his hands&mdash;like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The priest&rsquo;s hands were upon her, and he was
taking liberties no other man had ever done. She tried to arise from
the cushion where she knelt, but strong arms about <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1083" href="#xd21e1083" name=
"xd21e1083">56</a>]</span>her prevented. Then the priest stepped from
the confessional and held her in his arms.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Did he kiss you&mdash;like this?&rdquo; the
priest asked. &ldquo;Did he press you to his bosom&mdash;like
this?&rdquo; She was now in his embrace, struggling in vain to free
herself. &ldquo;Nay, do not struggle, little bird. If you grant such
favors to enemies of religion, you ought not to refuse them to
representatives of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How can you call yourself a representative of the
Lord when you do these things?&rdquo; she managed to ask between his
kisses.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why, <i>Chuleta</i>, did not the Holy Ghost
overshadow even the blessed virgin? And is it not an honor to be
embraced by one who stands, as it were, in the very person of Christ?
If you have yielded to the enemy of the Master, ought you not yield to
the true representative of the Master, and so make atonement to
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">For answer, she managed to free one hand and slap his
face.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You do not know the manner of my country,&rdquo;
said the priest, thrusting his hand in her bosom. &ldquo;The
instructions for confession, issued by Saint Liguori, says:
&lsquo;Kisses, embraces, squeezing of the hands and similar things not
indecent, if done only as marks of affability or benevolence, according
to the custom of the country, in an honest way, are not sins.&rsquo;
Again: &lsquo;To speak, hear, read, write indecent things with a
legitimate reason is no sin. Hence, in order to administer the
sacrament of penance priests can lawfully hear and read all they
wish.&rsquo; Tell me what this insurgent did to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The girl wrenched herself away, and, flying to the door,
tried to open it. The priest stood and smiled. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1101" href="#xd21e1101" name=
"xd21e1101">57</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The case is hopeless,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
might as well confess.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you no regard for your sacred calling? Have
you no regard for this sacred place?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nothing is more sacred than love,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Saint Liguori says: &lsquo;Concerning the locality, every
external carnal action, although hidden in a sacred place, is a
sacrilege. However, cells, a cloister, the vestry, the roof above the
church, its door and vestibule, are excluded.&rsquo; You see we are
excused.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Excused! Oh, the wickedness of your heart! I
wonder not that Saguanaldo broke away from the church you
represent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nay, child, you misunderstand. If it is given to
Peter and his successors to forgive sins, then whatever they may do can
be no sin, but is, as it were, the act of God himself. You who think
your highest virtue is to love God ought to esteem it an honor that you
have provoked the love of God&rsquo;s representative on
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Fiend!&rdquo; shrieked the girl. &ldquo;Help,
help!&rdquo; The words echoed from the wall, but seemed to penetrate no
further.</p>
<p class="par">There was no response, and the priest smiled: &ldquo;It
is foolish to resist the Lord who loves you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
is in my power to absolve you from sin, and even to grant you
indulgence to commit that which might under other circumstances be sin.
Don&rsquo;t be foolish, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><a id="xd21e1117" name="xd21e1117"></a>He sought to
grasp her in his arms again, but she eluded him. Then he began in a
pleading voice:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is it my fault that I love you? Why are you not
as kind to me as you were to that heretic? You are in the confessional,
and I can not only absolve you from sin, but I am also pledged to
secrecy. Be kind to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, loathsome thing, I hate you.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1124" href="#xd21e1124" name=

<p class="par">&ldquo;But I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Love, indeed! You pollute the word, like you do
the office you hold and the building here and all else that should be
sacred.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You know not how I love you. Oh, how I long
toward you! &lsquo;<i lang="la">Item ordinarie mortalia nabenda sunt

"xd21e1133src">1</a>&rsquo; Are you not, indeed, the bride of

<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, devil that you are! It is you who have

every day such villainy as this, I could but hate you worse with every
morn, and never could forgive you. If there is hell, where he who burns
in lust and anger, burns in flame, then there&rsquo;s your place. If
there is a heaven that hears the voice of innocence, sending the white
angels down to give it succor, then will the heaven open now, and
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1141" title=

Oh, thou divine Christ, come now and judge between us. Oh, God of
purity, deliver me from this, thine enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You do not understand. I wish you no wrong. Love
is not wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Love thinketh no evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Love is not expressed in words. It never can be
told, but in embraces and fondlings. Christ, how I love you and long
toward you! &lsquo;<i lang="la">Delectatio venerea autem seu

comprehend how I am stirred.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You know not how you fright me. Oh, sir, I plead
with you to let me go. Do not for a moment&rsquo;s passion damn your
own soul and ruin me forever. Show but the manhood that will set me
free, and for that manhood&rsquo;s sake I will say that, though
tempted, you had the hardihood to overcome, <span class=

silent as to all you have done and said.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What do you think I am? Does the sportsman set
the bird free when it chirps? I am not so foolish or so
weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then let me ask one thing: Did my father deliver
me into your hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd21e1163" title=

<p class="par">&ldquo;He is.&rdquo;</p>

dark. I also have full license now for anything I can do, and you can
find no fault in the fault that marked both your parents. Come and give
me a kiss, like a good girl, <i>Chuleta</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;God in heaven, send me protection,&rdquo; gasped
the girl in a faint voice.</p>
<p class="par">A moment later the priest grasped her in his arms, and
his lips seized hers in a long, hard, passionate kiss. <span class=

<p class="par first">Early the following morning Ambrosia Lonzello was
released from the <i>convento</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1187src"
href="#xd21e1187" name="xd21e1187src">1</a> in which she had been
detained the night long, and staggered into the street. Suffering
physically, nervous almost to prostration, and mentally overwhelmed
with horror, she walked, she scarcely knew where. She felt that she
dare not go home&mdash;that father and mother had betrayed her, and
that now she was an outcast, with no friend and with no place on earth.
Even heaven had been deaf to her call, and she felt that the divine
Father, too, and the Christ who had sympathized with Magdalene, cared
nothing for her.</p>
<p class="par">It is a wise provision of nature, apparently attesting
her sympathy with suffering, that when sorrow and pain tug almost to
the point of destruction at the heart or body, she provides her own
opiate. In the article of death almost all creatures are at peace, and
fear nothing. Gradually this numbness came over Ambrosia. She
apparently could not realize all that had happened. She ceased to feel
the full burden of her anguish, and became numb, as it were. She no
longer planned, she followed her heart. Indeed, she became more
conscious of the glory of the morning than of her own ruin, and in
spite of her mind&rsquo;s declaration that there was no place in the
world for her, she saw nature beautiful and friendly about her and felt
that not yet had God excluded her.</p>
<p class="par">Her brain would not work, but her heart thought of
Saguanaldo and those whom she had thought to be her friends. It was
this thread invisible that led her to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1196" href="#xd21e1196" name="xd21e1196">61</a>]</span>camp of
the Americans. When she arrived she met first a minor officer and asked
to be shown to the commander in charge.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;All right, Miss, just go into the tent and wait
until I bring him,&rdquo; was the reply to her request.</p>
<p class="par">She entered the tent and seated herself. As she waited a
feeling of drowsiness overpowered her. Finally, scarcely knowing what
she did, she threw herself on the cot in the tent and slept. The
soldier who occupied the tent peeped in and saw her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; said he to his messmate, &ldquo;she
don&rsquo;t want the commander now. She has already made a night of it
and needs nothing so bad as sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait till she awakens and then keep
her to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We ought to have some rent for our
tent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When Ambrosia awakened several hours later one of the
soldiers was at her side and the tent was closed and darkened. She
remained in the tent two days, during which time she was repeatedly
assaulted by the two soldiers. Instead of finding a refuge, she had
merely fallen into another trap. There really is no escape for a
creature that is hunted, especially if that creature be a woman.<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">When next Ambrosia Lonzello regained consciousness
she was reposing in a room familiar to her, at the home of Mrs. Rizal.
After her last bitter experience she had been cast into the street in a
fever and delirium, and, happily for her, had soon been picked up by
Mrs. Rizal, who had taken her to her home and nursed her through a
siege of fever. Now, as Ambrosia opened her eyes with a rational look,
Mrs. Rizal, smiling on her, said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are better now.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How do I come to be here?&rdquo; asked the girl
in confusion.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I found you wandering on the street in a fever
and brought you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, then it is true,&rdquo; cried the girl in
horror as memory came to her. &ldquo;I must go, I am not fit to be in
this room with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; responded the older woman,
smoothing her pillow. &ldquo;You have been having bad dreams, and you
must forget about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are you sure they were dreams?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Perfectly. You have been very sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Where is mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;She has been to see you often, and will come
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Did she say where I had been?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;She said you had started to confessional, and I
suppose the fever came upon you while you were on the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The girl lay silent for a time. Finally tears gathered
in her eyes. It was a good sign that the power of crying had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1249" href="#xd21e1249" name=
"xd21e1249">63</a>]</span>returned to her; tears are a mark of
humanity, and only they who are dehumanized or rendered outcasts by
persecution or sorrow are unable to weep. Mrs. Rizal stooped and kissed
the girl. It was the one act of sympathy she needed to break up the
fountains of her heart, for it showed that she was not entirely
abandoned, and Ambrosia wept unrestrainedly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You will be better now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rizal
when the flood of tears had passed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Does&mdash;General Saguanaldo know?&rdquo; asked
Ambrosia.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If he did, he would have come.&rdquo; Again it
was the wisest word that could have been spoken, simple and unlearned
though it may have been, for it intimated that her lover had not ceased
to care, and this was of all things the most consoling. Yet a moment
after it occurred to Ambrosia that if Saguanaldo had desired to come
and not been able, he, too, had been burdened and in trouble. Then it
was, with a woman&rsquo;s abnegation, Ambrosia thought of the woe of
her dear one rather than of her own sorrow, and this, too, was an
advantage to her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are they having trouble at the front?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mrs. Rizal replied. &ldquo;The friars
have seized on the churches, the hospitals and convents, and now the
American troops are maintaining them in possession of the property they
hold. It is the same as though the Americans, after <span class="corr"
id="xd21e1261" title="Source: Sagunaldo">Saguanaldo</span> had turned
the city of Manila over to them, had turned against him and were making
war on him and in favor of the friars.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Someone is behind this change,&rdquo; declared
the girl after a moment&rsquo;s thought.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, there is a Jesuit here, an envoy from the
Pope.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ambrosia sat up in bed, her eyes distended in
horror.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then it is true,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was
not a dream. It was good in you to care for me and not desert me in my
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1273" href="#xd21e1273" name=
"xd21e1273">64</a>]</span>pollution, but I know now it is true, and you
need not deny it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But<span class="corr" id="xd21e1277" title=
"Not in source">,</span>&rdquo;&mdash;began Mrs. Rizal.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I will not talk about it,&rdquo; interrupted the
girl, &ldquo;and God will reward you who are so different from other
women in that you did not turn away from the victim as from a thing
polluted. No, do not interrupt. I am strong now. There is only one
thing I may do with the remnant of life left to me. I have no longer
father or mother, God or redeemer. I have no place in society on earth.
I have no lover, no chance for home or respectability. But I have hope
and a purpose. It has just come to me. Do not deny me in the plan I
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I will listen to your plan, but you are weak and
not yet able to do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The girl leaped out of the bed, let down her hair and
hunted a pair of shears. &ldquo;Cut off my hair, closely,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I fear you are not yet over the fever,&rdquo;
remonstrated Mrs. Rizal.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have had no fever,&rdquo; said the girl,
&ldquo;and I am well. I shall be strong for vengeance and justice. Nay,
do not fear, good Mother Rizal, I am sane.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You have not told me your plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Inasmuch as Ambrosia Lonzello has lost all place
in society and on earth, she had the fever and is dead. She is merely
another victim of the friars. I, who stand before you, am not Ambrosia
Lonzello. I am a man, now and henceforth. I feel within me the vigor
and courage of manhood, proving the transformation. Henceforth I shall
live only for vengeance and to assist Saguanaldo, who had been
Ambrosia&rsquo;s friend. Cut off the hair that belies my sex, and then
we all go to the field to give our lives for the cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Rizal expostulated, but in vain. She argued as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1296" href="#xd21e1296" name=
"xd21e1296">65</a>]</span>to the girl&rsquo;s lack of strength, but was
actually laughed out of the idea. At last she fell in with the plan,
both as being in accord with her own desire and also as being perhaps
the only course open to the girl after what had happened.</p>
<p class="par">A few hours afterward, then, the transformation was
completed. The girl, with her hair cropped close and wearing a suit
that had belonged in days past to Dr. Rizal, looked very much like a
vigorous young man, and Mrs. Rizal was gratified to find that she
showed no sign of failing physical powers. Indeed, she was to all
appearance well again.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You see, I have merely been transformed into a
new creature,&rdquo; said the youth, smiling and showing two rows of
perfect white teeth. &ldquo;My name is Hilario Agonoy, at your
service.&rdquo; Bowing low.</p>

<h2 class="main">OFF TO THE WAR.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The next day Mrs. Rizal and her companion, known
as Hilario Agonoy, set out into the country to join Saguanaldo.</p>
<p class="par">After they had proceeded a few miles beyond the city
they walked along through the jungle over a trail that was rough,
stumpy, stony, and at places almost overgrown and hidden by bamboo
growths, trees, ferns, and tropical grasses. Occasionally they came to
a grass hut in the midst of a little clearing, and here the friendly
peasants, who for the most part, knew Mrs. Rizal, extended their
hospitality in the form of invitations to remain with them. In places
the women would be at work in the rice fields or cultivating tobacco or
sugar cane. They were barefoot and bare armed, wearing only shifts that
but partly enveloped them, meagerly concealing their fine physiques.
Sometimes a man, barefoot and wearing only two garments, would be seen
following the carabao, the native ox, as it dragged the wooden plow
that scratched the soil.</p>
<p class="par">There were fields of abace or native hemp, rice and
indigo. Sometimes the pilgrims would pass through groves of mahogany or
cashu and see men at work with bolos, felling trees for lumber, or with
sierras<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1328src" href="#xd21e1328" name=
"xd21e1328src">1</a> slowly cutting boards from teque or mahogany.
Sometimes they saw them grinding cane in the <i lang=
"es">trapiche</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1335src" href="#xd21e1335"
name="xd21e1335src">2</a>. Sometimes at night they saw the <i lang=
"es">zanita</i>, the Philippine bee, working by moonlight and storing
its honey on the underside of slanting branches; and one day, when the
bees were asleep Agonoy climbed a tree while <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1343" href="#xd21e1343" name=
"xd21e1343">67</a>]</span>the two laughed at his struggles, and the
honey he obtained constituted their supper. They passed
haciendas<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1345src" href="#xd21e1345" name=
"xd21e1345src">3</a> and pueblos<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1352src"
href="#xd21e1352" name="xd21e1352src">4</a>. Once they came upon a
cemetery where a couple of corpses were hanging, because the friends of
the dead could or would not put up enough money to pay for the
continuous burial in consecrated ground. Occasionally they were
&ldquo;given a lift,&rdquo; to use an American expression, on a
<i lang="es">carata</i>, behind a carabao. They saw at times the timid
<i lang="es">galina del monte</i>, the wild chickens that ranged the
forests, and at other times were regaled with the <i>anona</i> or
custard apple.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Now and then there were streams to cross. For the most
part these were waded or passed over on logs felled to bridge them,
though in a few cases there were rustic bridges made of bamboo
curiously woven together.</p>
<p class="par">Everywhere poverty was visible, poverty abject and
pitiable.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Now and then they came to villages where there were fine
brick churches and conventos; and a few other good buildings, beside
many huts that under the operation of the Spanish law poor people were
enabled to build. The churches were guarded by American soldiers, and
in almost every village the inevitable <i lang="es">convento</i> was
occupied by officers of the American army. Invariably the friar lands
were better cultivated and of a better quality than elsewhere, and
resembled the old plantations in the American southern states when they
were kept in good condition by slave labor; for the peasants bore the
marks of poverty and hard work.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The weather was enervating at all times, and often
dismal from the drenching tropical rains, for it was the rainy season.
Streams were up and the trails were muddy. During the heat of the day a
choking malarial steam arose from the earth as the moisture evaporated.
The people were kept <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1383" href=
"#xd21e1383" name="xd21e1383">68</a>]</span>much indoors. It was too
disagreeable even for a revolt against Spain.</p>
<p class="par">They inquired in private for Saguanaldo, and were told
that he had deserted the American army and gone into the interior.
Others of the Filipinos had followed his lead in desertion, but it
seemed that they had not yet come together into anything like an army.
As to his exact location, nobody knew. The Americans were looking for
him, too, and the natives were careful, even before Mrs. Rizal and
Agonoy, to not say too much.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Americans are going to force us into fighting
them,&rdquo; a Filipino told them in one of the villages. &ldquo;They
are overbearing and insulting, calling us &lsquo;niggers&rsquo; and
treating us as inferiors.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I feared as much. The Philippines are too rich
for them to give up. They want the islands for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let me show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Filipino led them to a hut where a man lay on a mat
within, evidently seriously injured.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Americans gave him the water cure. This
punishment was first learned from the Filipinos themselves.&rdquo; Said
the Filipino: &ldquo;They laid him on his back and pinioned his limbs.
Then they put a funnel in his mouth and held his nose while they poured
him so full of water that it ran out of his nose and eyes and ears. It
was horrible torture.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why did they do it?&rdquo; asked Agonoy, with
sinking heart.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In order to force him to reveal the whereabouts
of Saguanaldo. You see why I have to be careful as to what I say. All I
can do is to direct you to go on still further.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On they went passing into the primitive. They went even
into the region of the head hunters, where the beautiful and
symmetrical volcano, Mayon, lifted its green sides against <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1404" href="#xd21e1404" name=
"xd21e1404">69</a>]</span>the blue sky beyond; and here they saw the
warriors who adhered to the old ways, and, severing the heads of their
enemies with the bolos which they used also for clearing the roads
through the bamboo brakes, dried them and retained the gruesome relics,
reduced to a few inches in diameter, as trophies of war.</p>
<p class="par">But the savage tribes were kind to the pilgrims. They,
too, were at enmity with Spain and all they regarded as foreigners,
ready to take sides with Saguanaldo should he call them forth.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It seems to me they are more civilized and gentle
in their way than are the people from the West,&rdquo; said Agonoy.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No people are so destructive and wasteful as
those who call themselves civilized,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Rizal.
&ldquo;I am of them and understand them, and I tremble for the future
of the Filipinos. The Americans will bring the foreigner and the
natives will disappear before him. They will bring the machine, and
such as remain will be chained to it, and compelled to render to them a
tribute many times in excess of that which Spain has exacted from you.
You have been poor, but you have not starved. Civilization brings the
slum and abject hunger.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Agonoy answered not. He was thinking about something
that to him seemed to be a dream, yet which he knew to be true&mdash;of
the awful experiences of a girl, to all intents and purposes dead, who
had suffered at the hands of civilization, the apex of possible human
suffering.</p>
<p class="par">So the two walked on and on. Sometimes they heard of
Saguanaldo, and again lost trace of him. They passed on into wilder
regions, into places infested by <span class="corr" id="xd21e1417"
title="Source: mosquitos">mosquitoes</span>, snakes and other loathsome
things; to regions where mango birds were numerous and where the pigeon
of the crucifixion with the red cross on its breast had its habitat.
Often lost, they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1420" href=
"#xd21e1420" name="xd21e1420">70</a>]</span>could go but slowly;
sometimes they slept alone in the great forests. But ever they pressed
on.</p>
<p class="par">Finally, after days out, the two travelers came upon
Saguanaldo in a grass hut in a thicket near the southern end of the
island. As they approached, piloted by a friendly Igorrote, Saguanaldo
arose in evident surprise. After exchanging greetings Mrs. Rizal
said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;General Saguanaldo, we came to take with you the
fortunes of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<span class="corr" id="xd21e1428" title=
"Source: Senora">Se&ntilde;ora</span> Rizal, you are welcome. We shall
need all the soldiers we can gather, and your advice will be valuable
in this time of trouble. The name of the boy&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hilario Agonoy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rizal,
quickly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are welcome. <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1435" title="Source: Senora">Se&ntilde;ora</span> Rizal and the
boy; we shall want you both at the council of war which we are about to
hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Private soldiers are not often taken into
councils,&rdquo; suggested Agonoy.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, yes, they are when there are only three
present,&rdquo; suggested Saguanaldo, with grim humor. But Agonoy did
not join in the laugh that followed.</p>
<p class="par">By Saguanaldo&rsquo;s side sat Bishop Aglipay, Obispo
Maximo, the leader of the revolt against the friars. Only these four
were left, though others were ready to take up arms when Saguanaldo
suggested. It was a pitiful remnant of the gay throng that had such a
short time ago celebrated Philippine independence, hailing Saguanaldo
as president. Saguanaldo began:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We shall need to confer as to the best mode of
procedure, because we are in desperate situation. We are in a much
worse shape than before the American army came. Then we were in
possession of more than half the churches in the Philippines, and
besides that, held Manila. But now <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1446" href="#xd21e1446" name="xd21e1446">71</a>]</span>I have
been tricked away from the Philippine capital, and the American troops
are protecting the churches for the friars.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How did they come to get the churches which you
had?&rdquo; Mrs. Rizal was addressing Aglipay. She knew, but wanted his
version of it.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We were fearing nothing,&rdquo; the leader of the
schism explained, &ldquo;when in one night, just before the American
troops arrived on the scene, Spanish soldiers seized on the churches
while we slept. The next day the American troops came, and as, it
appears, they had been ordered to protect in possession of their
properties whoever they might find in possession of them, they at once
became allies of the friars.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And here I, who was with them,&rdquo; exclaimed
Saguanaldo indignantly, &ldquo;I, who had given them peaceable
possession of Manila, was ordered to protect the friars in possession
that they gained by trickery.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Rizal.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do? I passed the word to as many of my followers
as possible, and fled. Not one of them came, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That seems to have been the best thing you could
have done&mdash;for the friars,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Rizal. &ldquo;In
doing that you became rebellious against the United States, and now, I
understand, have the American army on your trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That is true; but what else could I have done?
Had I done nothing I would have been fighting for the Spaniards, and,
as it were, against myself. I had the Americans against me,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But now the case is hopeless. So long as the
Spaniards were your enemies, without outside help, there was some hope
that some day you might have beaten them. But, now that the Americans
are allies of the Spaniards the case is hopeless. It is too great a
nation for you to combat. Recall how the Spanish fleet melted away
before the American fleet in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1465" href="#xd21e1465" name="xd21e1465">72</a>]</span>bay of
Manila and tell me what chance you will have before the giant foe from
across the seas.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why the Americans turned
against us, when they came here to fight the Spaniards,&rdquo; said
Aglipay gloomily.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The reason is very plain,&rdquo; returned the
woman.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Was it that they were offended at me because I
had been made president of the Filipino republic?&rdquo; asked
Saguanaldo.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are the American people, then, not lovers of
liberty, and are they merely waging a war of conquest in the name of
liberty?&rdquo; Aglipay asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The answer is found in the fact that there is not
a member of the Filipino Catholic church in all America, while there
are ten million Roman Catholics there.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, political reasons, then,&rdquo; suggested the
bishop. He as an olden friar understood something of how politics
modified policies.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes. Though your schism might have a greater
power here than the friars have, it commands no influence in America.
The American who favors the other side will have friends at home, while
one who would favor you would find enemies there that might destroy his
influence and his future. You are not only fighting the American army
here, and the friars here, but also, as it were, all the people of
America.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The two men reflected moodily for a few minutes.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There is nothing to do but to fight until we
perish,&rdquo; said Saguanaldo.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One should not die for a cause unless there is
good cause for the sacrifice. Do you find that the people rally to
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the insurgent bitterly.
&ldquo;They sympathize <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1492" href=
"#xd21e1492" name="xd21e1492">73</a>]</span>and see the danger, but it
seems they have not the interest that dares to risk all and
fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Even the men you can command are not disciplined
or drilled or properly equipped.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No. The Americans have the equipment I had
collected.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nor would the various tribes be likely to cling
together,&rdquo; suggested the woman.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This cursed race feeling! The only way the tribes
will stay together is when they war with each other; then they are
together in battling each other.&rdquo; There was dogged bitterness in
Saguanaldo&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I do not see how you can win by fighting. What
does a grinning skull care for <span class="corr" id="xd21e1505" title=
"Source: gengeance">vengeance</span>? But there is a way in which you
may win, General Saguanaldo.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How,&rdquo; asked the general, eagerly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;By yielding. It is often the surest way of
winning. You have an unexpected ally.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;None other than the Pope at Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Pope!&rdquo; exclaimed both men in a
breath.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes. The Pope understands that the Spanish friars
are at the bottom of the long trouble in the Philippines and is glad of
the war that will give him an excuse for removing them. That will be a
victory for him; and, as he has already managed to get possession of
the churches, it means a victory for the church as well. If you can get
the friendship of America, so that the country will treat you justly,
it will also be a victory for the Filipino people.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And I am to lose all that I have struggled
for?&rdquo; protested Saguanaldo.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And I to lose the organization which I have built
up through the years?&rdquo; added the Bishop. <span class=

<p class="par">&ldquo;Better to lose these things alone than to lose
both them and your lives as well,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Rizal.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If a common soldier might be permitted to
speak&rdquo;&mdash;faltered Hilario Agonoy.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Say what you wish,&rdquo; suggested the insurgent
general. &ldquo;We are all equal in our love for the cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I prefer to fight even though I know we must
lose. There is some satisfaction in punishing those who have treated us
so unjustly, and every blow we strike will cause them to have the
greater respect for the Filipino people in the future. If we could
punish that Jesuit&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And Bishop Lonzello,&rdquo; added Aglipay.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To my mind there is nothing left us to do but
fight,&rdquo; added General Saguanaldo, visibly pleased. &ldquo;We in
the interior can conduct a guerrilla warfare that will cause the enemy
to respect us, and make the new masters more inclined to do us justice.
I trust, <span class="corr" id="xd21e1538" title=

we take this action.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Rizal arose. &ldquo;I am with, you to the
last,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am not afraid to die, either, just as
my husband died before me. If I may be asked to designate the service I
am to perform, I would ask that the youth here and I be permitted to go
among the people and arouse them with our songs and speeches. We can
rally you a force, General.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Go, and God bless you. There is one question I

<h2 class="main">THE COLLEGE YELL.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Mrs. Rizal and Hilario Agonoy, after much effort,
succeeded in rallying a force to Saguanaldo. It was a <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e1564" title="Source: motly">motley</span> crowd,
composed of representatives of several different tribes, armed with
shot guns, bolos and whatever they could secure, and garbed all the way
from a soldier&rsquo;s uniform to breech clouts and feathers. There
were perhaps five thousand of them, all told.</p>
<p class="par">With this force, Saguanaldo began a careful march toward
the north part of the island. Mrs. Rizal and Agonoy went ahead and
discovered that a force of Americans were advancing inland to meet
them. Consequently Saguanaldo stopped at the banks of the Rio Grande,
and prepared rifle pits. He also removed from the bridge that crosses
the stream the flooring, leaving only the sills, the girders, and cross
pieces about every seven feet apart. The first night after these
preparations had been made the American troops appeared and encamped on
the bank opposite, some 300 feet away.</p>
<p class="par">The Filipinos were not inclined to attack, but relied on
the river, which was high and threatening, to keep the enemy from them.
Yet the second night, about 11 <span class="corr" id="xd21e1571" title=
"Source: a. m.">p. m.</span>, the cackling and crowing of chickens at
farm houses on the other side, and part way down stream, told them that
some movement was in progress. It was immediately across the stream
from where Agonoy had been stationed with some threescore natives. At
the time the clatter began the moon came out, and it was revealed that
a force of Americans was at work <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1574" href="#xd21e1574" name="xd21e1574">77</a>]</span>on the
margin of the river, evidently trying to launch some rafts with a view
to crossing. Agonoy directed the men to fire, and a <span class="corr"
id="xd21e1576" title="Source: fusilade">fusillade</span> from the
insurgents soon drove the Americans to cover. Hiding behind trees,
stumps, rocks or anything that would afford protection, they remained
silent until the fire of the insurgents ceased. Then, after a time,
they again made endeavor to launch their rafts, until the forces under
Agonoy once more drove them away.</p>
<p class="par">This first victory, won by the insurgents, gave them
great encouragement and Agonoy was publicly commended by the general.
It is still remembered that when this occurred the young officer first
blushed fiery red and then broke into tears.</p>
<p class="par">The day following the Americans undertook by daylight
the thing which they had before tried at night. But they began in a
little different way. They were seen to dump some rafts into the river
over a high bank, and then two men, stripped to the skin, dived into
the stream and began to swim across. The insurgents peppered at them,
while the Americans from the other shore shot at every head among the
Filipinos that showed itself. Bullets splashed on all sides of the
swimmers, but none took effect. As they drew to shore they were
protected by the bank, the Filipinos being unable to fire at them
because of thus exposing themselves. Then it was seen that they had
borne a cable across the stream. It became apparent that the intention
was to hitch it so some object on the Filipino side of the river and
thus form a means of propelling the rafts across the stream. But the
two naked, unarmed white men, alone on the Filipino side of the Rio
Grande, were unable to find a place to which to hitch. Daubed with dirt
and glistening with the water, they raced back and forth under
protection of the bank, looking for stump or tree, but in vain.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1583" href="#xd21e1583" name=
"xd21e1583">78</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There is a stump in the rifle pit, up
there,&rdquo; remarked one.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We must hitch to that,&rdquo; said the other.
&ldquo;Make you some mud balls.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They scooped up mud from the river and hugged to their
breasts the balls of filth as they started to climb the banks directly
ahead of them. Meantime the American soldiers fired over their heads.
As they arose over the bank and stood erect looking into the rifle
pits, they began throwing the mud balls. The first one struck Agonoy
full in the face, and the young commander, with eyes and mouth full of
dirt, began clawing at the mud and retreating. The natives, seeing
this, and not knowing the nature of the new weapon, broke into a run
and retreated.</p>
<p class="par">Meantime a raft had started across the stream, with two
men and the clothing and guns of the men who were now tying the cable
to the stump. When midstream the rope slipped and the raft upset,
precipitating all in the water. The two men reached shore, but the
clothing of the men who had swum the river was lost. Other rafts were
on the way. Before Agonoy could rally the natives, a small force of
Americans had crossed over.</p>
<p class="par">Then began an opera bouffe charge; naked and begrimed
Americans and men in khaki against naked and half-clothed
representatives of a half a dozen races! And as the Americans came on a
run they broke into a college yell:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Rock chalk,</p>
<p class="line">Jay hawk,</p>
<p class="line">Chicken hawk,</p>
<p class="line">Tommy hawk,</p>
<p class="line">K. U.!</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">There was a peculiar laughable twist on the
&ldquo;U.&rdquo; that added to the grotesqueness of the incident.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1608" href="#xd21e1608" name=
"xd21e1608">79</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">By this time they were reinforced by a small body of men
who had crossed the bridge on the girders, and as these came up yelling
other college yells and firing as rapidly as possible, at nothing, the
Filipinos, in utter consternation, broke ranks and fled.</p>
<p class="par">In the course of a few hours, however, Saguanaldo, who
understood the lay of the country thoroughly, had again brought his
forces into order and had forded the river a little lower down. He was
now on the side of the stream nearest Manila, while the Americans,
after all had crossed and they had leisurely partaken of dinner, were
hunting him further in the interior. It had been a bloodless battle,
with the victory apparently on one side and yet the advantage decidedly
on the side of the defeated.</p>
<p class="par">After the troops had been collected Saguanaldo called
Agonoy to him and said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The honors of the first encounter belong to you.
Name the reward you desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;All I wish is to serve my country further,&rdquo;
replied the youth with another blush. &ldquo;Permit me to go ahead to
Manila and inform you how to take the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Another should accompany you, so that if
something happens to one the other may escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Permit me to go to spy out the land,&rdquo; asked
Bishop Aglipay.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You, Bishop?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes. Let each go in his own way and alone. Then
we can report and will not be in collusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Does that suit you, <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1630" title="Source: Senor">Se&ntilde;or</span> Agonoy?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1633" href="#xd21e1633" name=
"xd21e1633">80</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I shall be satisfied. If we can wreak vengeance
on the bishop&rsquo;s enemy, the Jesuit, I shall be repaid for all
dangers and suffering that may ensue.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then go, and success attend your efforts,&rdquo;
returned Saguanaldo. And he looked on the youth with searching eyes
that for a third time caused Agonoy to blush. <span class=

<p class="par first"><span class="corr" id="xd21e1645" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>I&rsquo;m going to invite Judge Daft to
occupy this convento,&rdquo; suggested Violeta to Bishop Lonzello, a
few days after he arrived.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You will do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; replied
the bishop. &ldquo;It is a little too much, you coming here and
ordering us from the islands; but, as if this was not sufficient, now
you want us to give up our dormitories. I may yield the land for the
good of the church, but I am not going to stand this individual insult
from a stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, be reasonable,&rdquo; persuaded the Jesuit.
&ldquo;I am doing it solely for your good. You will get the rental for
it, and a republic is never niggardly in such matters. The convento is
really the only suitable building in Manila for the purpose, and we can
use the tender of it in cementing a very valuable pact. Depend on it,
you will lose nothing by it. Another thing&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i lang="es">Nombre de Dios!</i> Is there
anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Of course there is. We must syndicate the friar
lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If the United States undertakes to deal with the
friars as individuals, it will be able to handle them to its notion.
But by combining the 1,500 owners in a syndicate where half a dozen
have the full control of things, we can dictate terms. You can see the
advantage of this. It is the modern way of doing business. You managed
the seizure of the churches well; now you must organize the friars for
purpose of selling their lands advantageously.<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1663" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1666" href="#xd21e1666" name=
"xd21e1666">82</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The two priests discussed the matter further, and though
Lonzello was bitter against the Jesuit and in his heart resented the
new order that was being installed, he saw the force of the arguments,
and ere long started on a trip through Luzon for the purpose of
organizing the syndicate. During his absence the Jesuit took occasion
to tender the convento to Judge Daft and to point out its superiority
for the private uses of the new officials. The argument was valid,
because the convento was the best residence property in Manila. The
Jesuit went further and offered not only the church property in Manila,
but also in Malalos and throughout all the Philippines. Judge Daft
argued with his conscience, against his inclination to have the use of
the best, and ultimately accepted the <span class="corr" id="xd21e1669"
title="Source: offier">offer</span>. With the American governor housed
in the convento where the Jesuit lived, meetings became informal and
frequent. The two drove together in the evenings along the Plaza de
Gotta. They played golf together of afternoons. They met and talked as
friends; and the papal nuncio constantly and persistently employed the
power of suggestion for developing his plan.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I do not think we can elect you president short
of eight to twelve years, but it will come some day,&rdquo; he told
Daft while at golf. Small business is transacted in the shops, larger
in offices, and the greatest business of the world is forwarded at
social gatherings and in games.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I supposed I was to be elected next week,&rdquo;
suggested the governor, facetiously.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, the people of America will probably demand a
military man first. There is such a one who begins to loom up as a
possibility, and he understands the situation thoroughly. Besides, he
is not so timid as the present president. The latter means well, but he
will not act until he is pushed into action, while in adopting new
policies, such as are coming <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1679"
href="#xd21e1679" name="xd21e1679">83</a>]</span>up now, we need a bold
man. You want to keep your eye on Colonel Rosefield. We have had our
eyes on him and he understands it. We mean to see that he has a
military record manufactured for him, so he can run for president.
After him comes Judge Daft.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You Jesuits are too deep politicians for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You will at least admit we are not dreamers,
Judge. I am in earnest in what I say. No man in the service in Cuba has
received the advertising so far that this Colonel Rosefield has had,
and there is a reason for it. He will emerge from the war the central
hero of it all, even if we have to make him the winner of a battle
where he was not present. More history is made by well circulated
reports than there is by deeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Judge laughed: &ldquo;I wonder if you intend to
circulate reports about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That depends. If you do justice by us, we will
see to the advertising, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What do you mean by justice?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, the Holy See is doing you inestimable
service in withdrawing the Spanish friars from the Philippines, because
it is thus removing the very source of the quarrel and enabling you to
gain a world reputation by accomplishing within a few years that which
the Spanish government failed to accomplish in three centuries. That is
a good start toward the presidency.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It seems you have tricked me into payment for
that service, which I freely acknowledge, because you have used the
order that those in possession of church property shall be maintained
in possession of that property to your advantage, by seizing on all the
property before the American troops arrived on the scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A mere act of justice. That property belonged to
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1697" href="#xd21e1697" name=
"xd21e1697">84</a>]</span>holy church before the schism took it away,
and we have merely done to the schism what it first did to us. This is,
therefore, a mere act of reparation; but we are not ungrateful to you
that you have made it possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The judge was secretly troubled at the part he had
played. It was not in accord with his conception of right. But he
readily saw that it was good politics, played for him by a power he did
not understand. He ventured to say:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I wish to do exact justice by you, and no
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We shall ask no more. In a sense the church in
general has had reparation; but what about the friars?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;His holiness, the Pope, can not banish them and
thus leave the field clear for you, unless they can be remunerated for
the lands they hold&mdash;not the churches, which belong to Rome, but
the lands, which belong to the friars. It is a matter of justice to pay
them for their property, and it would be of inestimable benefit to the
United States to get rid of this troublesome element.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I understand the ground on which these churches
were built belonged to the Spanish government, and that the government
contributed considerable cash besides toward their erection. This being
the case, the churches will belong to the United States after we shall
have acquired the Philippines, and you would owe the federal government
for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If the Spanish government gave the lands and
donations to the church they ceased to belong to Spain. You Americans
would not claim again land that had been patented to settlers. The
churches belong to Rome, where all titles to church property are
vested. You will have to settle with Rome for them. The land belongs to
the friars, who, as agents of Spain, developed the country and paid for
the land. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1714" href="#xd21e1714"
name="xd21e1714">85</a>]</span>You will have to settle with the friars
for them if you would banish that troublesome element.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Malalos convention declared them fortified to
the <span class="corr" id="xd21e1718" title=
"Source: Philipine">Philippine</span> republic.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Can you recognize that republic? You know you
dare not do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Daft understood that; after a pause he inquired.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What are the lands worth?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They have not been appraised, but I would
estimate their value at from twelve to fifteen millions of American
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It seems to me pretty high.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;On the contrary, it is reasonable, considering
the cost it would be to America to settle the trouble with the friars
still here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It seems to me you are faring pretty well,
considering that you have restored to you the churches that were in
revolt.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You will win with the friars gone, but there are
a number of things that will have to be settled by arbitration after
the war is over. You must act as America&rsquo;s representative to the
Pope.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Judge Daft started back in astonishment.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is impossible. It is against the policy of the
United States to recognize the temporal power of the Pope by sending an
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1742" title=
"Source: embassador">ambassador</span> to the <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1745" title="Source: vatican">Vatican</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nonsense. This war will make it necessary. You
may disguise him under the name of agent, if you will, but a
representative will become a necessity. It would be a big thing for you
to be that representative. You must have your picture taken with the
Pope.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The boldness of the declaration again startled Judge
Daft. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1752" href="#xd21e1752" name=
"xd21e1752">86</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You do not know the temper of the American
people. They would not stand for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It would give you two million Catholic votes and
make your election as president an assured thing. It is big politics we
are playing these days, and you might as well be in on it as
anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But can you make good?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t your national chairman declare that
the only power that could save America from Socialism was the Catholic
church? Did not the Catholic vote go to your present national
executive, for the first time in history that the republican party got
that vote? You are asked only to follow the policy set by your party,
and to reap the result in honors and power. Why do you suppose the head
of the church deserted Spain in this war, when Spain is a Catholic
country, and has been on the side of the Protestant United States, if
he did not expect recognition of his services? Do you not suppose we
understood from the time the Maine was blown up that the people might
be aroused to start this war? The hierarchy is hereafter to be a
dominating power in America, and you are to be president. It is a big
thought, and you must think over it, Judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Judge did think over it and the apostolic nuncio
kept from his presence several days in order to give him opportunity to
ponder the subject. When next the two men met the chastened attitude of
Judge Daft and his evident desire to be agreeable was to the discerning
Jesuit ample proof that the leaven was working.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; he added to himself,
&ldquo;but that the fine, bold material we are getting on our side may
necessitate the removal of the good-hearted old man who rules but fears
to move. We dare not wait too long when plans are ripe and boldness is
necessary.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1766" href=

<p class="par first">A few mornings after this the apostolic nuncio was
walking along the calzada by the coast, musing over his plans, when he
chanced upon three American soldiers with a Filipino prisoner. He was
inclined to pass on with only a cursory glance, but his ever-alert
mind, always spurred to observation, prompted to closer scrutiny. Then
he saw that the soldiers were drunk. This was not important in his eye,
because, under the canteen system inaugurated by the American
government, and the influence of the tropics working on the nerves of
the boys so far from home, and of the Filipino beverage, <i>vino</i>,
drinking was rather common with the soldiers. Indeed, the tropics were
playing havoc with the morals of the youth in khaki.</p>

makes him run amuck, had been getting in its work on the Americans, and
they were more or less beside themselves even now. Besides, insidious
fever, the <i>mali-mali</i>, which weakens the will, leaving the victim
<i>chiflado</i>, ready to imitate the movements of any who pass; the
almost constant vibration of the soil that tells so on American nerves;
the absence from home and accountability to civilized restraints; the
enervating tropics that seemed to tingle in their veins and vanish,
make them devilish; and the daily sight of half-naked women, whose
ideals of morality were tropical rather than American, were telling on
the habits of many a homesick mother&rsquo;s boy. The Philippines
became a hot-bed in which erotic passions developed into national
scandals. The nuncio himself, with grim desire to strike at the
Americans when it profited his cause to do so, had procured the
licensing and inspection of bawds, under sanction of the American
governor, the fees for inspection going to church charities. So the
sights of drunken American soldiers did not even interest him.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">But there was something about the prisoner that was
striking. His very bearing, his mannerism, his cut of tie and clothing
proclaimed him to be a priest. If he was a Roman priest, the nuncio
felt he must rescue him; if he was an Aglipayan priest, then he might
gratify on him the cruel desire to torment which is born in some and
which he had fostered by feeding. He determined to put the matter to an
instant test by a bold stroke. So he approached the prisoner, crossing
himself and saying:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;As I live, if this is not Dr. Maximo Voliva, born
Aglipay.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It was a venture, but it struck home.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And you are that devil, Violeta, who has robbed
us already <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1837" href="#xd21e1837"
name="xd21e1837">89</a>]</span>of our churches. I am not pleased to
form your acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Still reprobate and unregenerate, I see,&rdquo;
returned the Jesuit. &ldquo;At one time we might have made terms with
you, but that day is past. We have the whip hand now and you are in our
power. Man (speaking to a soldier), run to the nearest house and borrow
a couple of spades or shovels, and be quick about it. Follow us down
the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The three men walked down the coast to a more secluded
spot.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What do you plan to do to me?&rdquo; asked the
erstwhile Maximo.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It will be time to discuss that when we come to
it. Do you wish to return to the true church and receive
absolution?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am in the true church,&rdquo; replied Aglipay,
hardly above a whisper. &ldquo;You will not murder me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We do not murder snakes and vermin when we
destroy them. And to think, you used to be a priest in the one true
church. You see now what your ambition brought you to.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ambition!&mdash;I would talk about ambition if I
were you. You, who have mastered the poor Filipinos; you, who are
planning for control of America! Ambition&mdash;may God forgive
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am sorry I can not return the compliment of
praying for your forgiveness, but you are so unrepentant. However, I
will hear your confession if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I will confess to God and not the
devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You might as well begin your confession
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Aglipay paled. But he faced the nuncio and spoke in a
calm voice: &ldquo;How can you profess religion, you who are so cruel,
so ambitious, so licentious? Do you really believe, or is it an open
mockery with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Violeta laughed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1864" href="#xd21e1864" name="xd21e1864">90</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;there is a God,
and truth, too, in religion. But it is moral to rise to your full
height, though you may trample others as you rise; and though it seem a
pity to devour the weaker creatures, no one thinks about it. It is a
part of feeding, and is right. We eat a woman&rsquo;s flesh as
&rsquo;twere a fowl&rsquo;s, and take a poor man&rsquo;s life as though
a bird&rsquo;s; that is, the great do, those with authority. It is
doing this that makes them great. Repression is but failure. Life and
success came from expression and experience. I am friendly with you
because we must part. Good-bye; Bishop.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He extended his hand, but the schismatist, pale and
unable to more than move mechanically, stared at him without offering
his hand. The nuncio laughed again, and carelessly said, &ldquo;Oh, as
you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">By this time they were in a shady place, secure from
observation by a clump of trees, and the other soldier approached with
a couple of shovels.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Scoop out a grave there, fellows,&rdquo; said the
Jesuit. &ldquo;You must not take your prisoners to headquarters if you
would avoid trouble. We will have a bit of fun by and by.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The soldiers were sufficiently drunk to be
irresponsible, and of a temperament to receive suggestions. They obeyed
the Jesuit without demurring, while he taunted the renegade Romish
priest, and then they came to him to inform him that all was ready.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tie the prisoner,&rdquo; said the Jesuit.</p>
<p class="par">They proceeded to pinion his legs and arms, and when
this was done the Jesuit continued:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now take him and throw him in the
trench.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i lang="es">Dios Mio!</i> You surely will not
bury me alive,&rdquo; plead the leader of the schism, as they lifted
him and deposited him in the rude and shallow grave. For answer the
Jesuit bade the soldiers seize the shovels and fill up the sand over
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1887" href="#xd21e1887" name=
"xd21e1887">91</a>]</span>the body, leaving the head uncovered. Aglipay
begged and prayed, as shovelful after shovelful of sand fell upon him,
first rendering him powerless to move, and then bearing upon him with a
weight intolerable. His face was blanched, his eyes stood out,
bloodshot in horror. For answer to his pleading the Jesuit produced a
prayer book and began to read in mockery the service of the dead:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;From the pains of death, good Lord, deliver
me.&rdquo; Aglipay gritted his teeth, but his soul responded in a
sincerer prayer than the Jesuit uttered.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;From the pains of hell and the agony of the
grave&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good Lord, deliver me,&rdquo; plead the man in
the grave.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Silence the disturber of our devotions,&rdquo;
commanded the Jesuit.</p>
<p class="par">One of the soldiers lifted a shovelful of sand and threw
it in the face of the man man in the grave. Some grains entered his
eyes, but as he lay in agony, because gravel filled his mouth, he could
only groan and sputter without speaking.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;His mouth shall be filled with gravel,&rdquo;
quoted the Jesuit, with unfeeling sarcasm. <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1902" title="Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Fill in the grave,
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The soldiers shoveled for a moment and the remains of
Aglipay were buried from sight, literally buried alive. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Of course, the death of Aglipay became noised
abroad. Indeed, the Jesuit took no pains to keep it from being known,
because he felt that the death of the leader would have an important
effect in ending the schism. The death was a matter susceptible of
proof from the fact that the body was found, but that he was buried
alive could not be proven save from the participants in the tragedy,
who were not required to testify against themselves. Rumors as to the
horrors of the fate of Dr. Obispo Maximo spread through Manila and
Luzon, and aroused the people to a high pitch of indignation. In a
sense, it was for the time beneficial to the revolt, because hundreds
now flocked to Saguanaldo, bringing their own weapons and ammunition,
and every region through which he passed was eager to feed the
soldiery, so that opposition to the friars gained strong headway again.
It became impossible for the Americans to ignore the matter. In order
to appease the inhabitants of Manila, the three soldiers were arrested
and placed on trial, before a court martial, for killing a prisoner.
They were found guilty and ordered shot.</p>
<p class="par">It was then that Violeta appeared before Judge Daft.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You must pardon these men,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Must is a strong word,&rdquo; returned the Judge,
flushing.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The reasons behind it are strong,&rdquo;
continued the Jesuit. &ldquo;The deed they did, while irregular, has
simplified matters amazingly, by removing the head and cause of the
schism, so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1923" href="#xd21e1923"
name="xd21e1923">93</a>]</span>that they did you an inestimable
service. You can not afford to show ingratitude toward what they
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But it was murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Manslaughter, perhaps. America is at war, not
only with Spain, but also with this <span class="corr" id="xd21e1929"
title="Source: schims">schisms</span>, and all war is manslaughter.
Rainey&rsquo;s victory was manslaughter. Manslaughter among soldiers is
not a crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It seems to me you assume a great deal in saying
that we are at war with this schism.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You will be, which is the same thing. The
Aglipayans over all the archipelago are in arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, and this deed precipitated it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Precipitated it, perhaps; that does not mean that
was the cause of the revolt. It was bound to come anyhow, and the
sooner it comes the cheaper it will be for America; the quicker you
win, the greater your reputation will be. The United States could not
occupy the archipelago and leave the Philippine republic intact, you
know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Judge Daft thought in silence, pacing the floor. Then,
seating himself at his desk, he wrote:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Commander of American Forces:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Sir: Manslaughter in war is not a crime, though,
if irregular, may be an offense. You will place the slayers of Aglipay

until discipline is conserved, then release them for
service.&mdash;Benjamin Daft, Governor.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="main">THE WOMAN OF IT.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">When news of the death of Aglipay reached her,
near Manila, Hilario Agonoy was awakened to sufficient interest to plan
something for herself. She straightway thought that if she could appear
before Judge Daft and plead against the Jesuit, even going so far as to
sacrifice herself by telling the whole story of Ambrosia Lonzello, she
might change the attitude of the United States and thus save the day
for the insurrectionists.</p>
<p class="par">Within a few days, therefore, Hilario Agonoy
disappeared. Ambrosia Lonzello again appeared before her mother at the
grass hut&mdash;her mother, who has mourned the mysterious
disappearance of Ambrosia&mdash;and made herself known&mdash;telling
the terrible story without concealment. The mother was stricken with
horror, and convinced her daughter that she was in no way culpable.
Woman&rsquo;s garments were again donned and Ambrosia Lonzello prepared
to appear, with her mother&rsquo;s consent, before Governor Daft to
tell her story.</p>
<p class="par">It was somewhat discouraging to Ambrosia to find the
Governor&rsquo;s headquarters in the convento, and to be compelled to
again visit the scene of her agony and ruin. But she nerved herself for
the ordeal. It was her fortune to be admitted to Judge Daft&rsquo;s
office, to find the Jesuit with him. To her it was a surprise and
shock. But perhaps it was as well. Had he been there, had he seen her
before she reached the governor, she might have been locked up again,
both to safeguard himself and satisfy anew his lust. And, after the
first shock of it had passed, the sight of her despoiler revived all
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1975" href="#xd21e1975" name=
"xd21e1975">96</a>]</span>strength within her into anger and hatred,
rendering her doubly powerful. Judge Daft kindly asked:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What can I do for you, my child?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hear me,&rdquo; replied the girl, trembling from
the intensity of her feeling. &ldquo;I come to ask for justice. That
man (pointing to the Jesuit) has wronged me. I came to the church to
confess, and he by force took me to the convento, where he locked and
kept me all night, using me as I can not tell, and making me, who
trusted him as a man of God, an outcast by his devil-deeds. I come to
call justice and God&rsquo;s vengeance upon him. But this is not all.
He it is who persuaded drunken soldiers to bury Bishop Aglipay
alive&mdash;alive, mind you; and as the poor man stifled in the sand,
this fiend who poses as a representative of God, mocked him by saying
the burial service over him. I come to call God&rsquo;s vengeance on
him, and to ask for justice, from you toward this enemy of
mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The girl was half hysterical, speaking in loud,
impassioned tones. Judge Daft sought to quiet her.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Be seated, my dear young lady,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;These are grave charges you make, and I shall look into them.
But be calm, I fear in your excitement you are exaggerating.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Exaggerating! I could not if I had a thousand
tongues, all eloquent, tell half the wrongs I feel. I could not, even
though educated as you are and as he is, reveal a tenth of what I have
suffered at his hands. I beg of you, for humanity&rsquo;s sake, for the
sake of your daughter, if you have one, hear me and give me
vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She fell on her knees before Judge Daft, who gently
lifted her and sat her in the chair. The Jesuit stood smiling and
serene. The girl, scarce knowing what she did, arose and screamed:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You will not aid me. It is because you are as wax
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1992" href="#xd21e1992" name=
"xd21e1992">97</a>]</span>the hands of that devil, who by the hope of
power and position for yourself moulds you to his will. He induced you
to pardon the murderers of Aglipay. He persuaded you to have the army
seize on our churches. He has you in his house, directing you by
flattery and making you a tyrant from your very kindness. My curses on
you both! How hard and bitter this fierce world can be! It was my
father, my own father, Judge Daft, who delivered his daughter to this
fiend. And this man, my father, Bishop Lonzello, betrayed my mother
when she was young, so that I came into the world foredoomed to ruin
and disgrace. And you, you, Judge Daft, uphold this Jesuit in his
villainy and plots and will not hear my prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The over-wrought girl sank in a heap on the floor,
sobbing bitterly. The noise of her last speech had brought several
servants on the scene. To them Judge Daft turned and compassionately
said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Take her to a room, where she may
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What! A room in this convento?&rdquo; screamed
the girl arising. &ldquo;Back to the scene of horror? I did not think
this of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She was now attacking the servants with nails and fists,
pressing her way toward the door. She fought her way to the street, and
then ran at her fullest speed, away, anywhere, but away from the
convento.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Poor creature!&rdquo; cried the Jesuit in tones
of the deepest <span class="corr" id="xd21e2004" title=

short of where she did, an investigation would have been ordered, I
feel sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I wish it had been,&rdquo; commented Lonzello.
&ldquo;You deserve punishment for the wrong you did her.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be unreasonable,&rdquo; gently
expostulated the Jesuit. &ldquo;Her accusation was against you also,

<p class="par">The passionate Lonzello walked the floor nervously,
cursing under his breath.</p>

the Jesuit, quietly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When you leave, beast,&rdquo; hissed the
priest.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, you will have to leave soon. The people
demand it, and your successor is in the harbor. But I have other work

<p class="par">&ldquo;The mob will have you, too,&rdquo; returned the
bishop.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, no. I am under the protection of my good

<p class="par">&ldquo;You know I haven&rsquo;t anything.&rdquo;</p>

the miracle worker, and having hundreds come to your shrine seeking the

<h2 class="main">THE JUDGMENT.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A throng of the devout were gathered in Manila
cathedral. To a pillar near the pulpit Ambrosia Lonzello was chained.
Neither she or the audience knew, but wires connecting with the chains
ran under the floor to the pulpit, connecting them with a key on the
floor. Underneath it all was a powerful battery. It had all been
arranged secretly, at night, by the Jesuit, who was himself an expert
electrician. Bishop Lonzello occupied the pulpit.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We have come to the test by ordeal,&rdquo; he
told the people. &ldquo;It grieves me that any one of the flock should
have gone astray, but when the one who leaves the true fold is my own
daughter I am doubly grieved. And, as though it were not enough that
she should desert the true church and become a friend and companion of
the enemy of the church and state, she brings accusation against the
priests of the Lord, against her own father, and the apostolic nuncio.
You have heard these charges, for the unbelievers in the city take
pleasure in rolling the scandal under their tongues. It is beneath my
dignity to deny, it is beneath the dignity of the Pope&rsquo;s
messenger to deny, such preposterous things. We will call on the
Almighty to decide between us. But first, my daughter, let me beg of
you, before we reach this supreme test, recant and save
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He turned toward the girl, who was chained to the stake.
There were tears in his eyes, and feeling was in his voice. It was
evident he sincerely hoped she would clear the situation by recanting.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2062" href="#xd21e2062" name=
"xd21e2062">101</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ambrosia, save your father,&rdquo; he plead.
&ldquo;Say I did not do the awful thing you charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A father should not ask his daughter to perjure
herself in the house of the Lord. This is nearly as wicked as to send
me to confession in order I might in that holy place be made the victim
of another&rsquo;s lust. Priest&mdash;for you have been so unfatherly,
I will not call you father&mdash;you are guilty, and you know
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">As she spoke the people arose and stood, eager to catch
each word. Now that she was through they caught their breaths with a
gasp that was audible through all the edifice. The face of the man in
the pulpit grew white as his own surplice. His nails dug into the wood
of the pulpit.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Apply the test,&rdquo; said the Jesuit, arising
and standing by the other. Lonzello assayed to speak, but he could not
articulate.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Shall we call on God to decide between us?&rdquo;
asked the Jesuit of the congregation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The test, the test,&rdquo; came from over all the
house. Lonzello&rsquo;s face grew haggard. Many of the congregation
were surprised to see the man before them was old, with face deeply
wrinkled. But the Jesuit was placid, fully in command of himself and of
the situation. He raised his hands toward heaven, and remained silent
until the people grew tense, waiting for what might come.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Thou who didst destroy the guilty Jannes and
Jambres in the wilderness,&rdquo; he began impressively, &ldquo;thou
who didst reveal of old the stealer of the golden wedge, judge now, oh,
God, the truth between us here. If thy servants are guilty of the
things charged against us&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">He paused, not only that he might the more impress the
people, but also to place one arm about Lonzello that he might support
him in case his nerve should fail him and his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2083" href="#xd21e2083" name=
"xd21e2083">102</a>]</span>limbs grow weak; then, with the other hand
spread upward, he continued, impressively:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Strike us dead, oh, God, cause us to die at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Every person in the house was standing; every neck was
craned; every sound, even to the rustle of breathing, was stilled. A
moment passed in tense silence. Then the low voice of the Jesuit
continued:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Almighty has spoken. We live.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The people breathed again, audibly. Lonzello, his
strength partly returned and his anxiety burning into his very bones,
rushed from the pulpit to the post where his daughter was chained, and,
falling on his knees, begged piteously:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Confess, confess, Ambrosia, and end this horrible
thing. The father is on his knees to the daughter, begging you to
recant.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Confess!&rdquo; cried the girl with scorn.
&ldquo;That is the word you used to send me to slaughter, to be
devoured by that beast. Sweet father, you are, to ask a daughter to
swear to a lie in order to shield the man who wronged her. I know not
what foul plot you have framed here, but I do know in my soul of souls
I am as white as dawn and that your soul is black as night from which
the dawn is born. As for that creature in the robes of God, neighbors
and friends, I say he is a devil. His place is hell&mdash;however, not
to rule, but to find torment, now and everlasting.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Jesuit flushed slightly, but his voice was unruffled
as he asked:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Friends, shall we call the test of God on
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Lonzello plead, rushing back to
the pulpit, &ldquo;not on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A father may be pitied in pleading for a
child,&rdquo; the Jesuit said, quietly and without passion. &ldquo;I
would, if I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2106" href="#xd21e2106"
name="xd21e2106">103</a>]</span>could, spare him, and her as well. Let
me, for his sake, girl, ask you to speak the word that shall save both.
Recant, recant.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Repent, repent,&rdquo; returned Ambrosia, facing
him fiercely. &ldquo;The crime is on your head; the crime on me, the
crime upon my father, the crime which now I feel you mean to do, are
all upon your head. Repent, repent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The girl is obdurate,&rdquo; said the Jesuit,
turning again to the people. &ldquo;In spite of vindication heaven
sent, she has reiterated accusations. Therefore, we shall be forced to
call on heaven again to choose between us. Shall we do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The test, the test!&rdquo; cried the people in
one voice.</p>
<p class="par">Again the right hand of the Jesuit was raised, again the
left stole round Lonzello, gripping him as with a vice. His toe sought
the hidden key under the pulpit as he intoned:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Choose now between us, which of us is right. If
we are guilty, send from heaven the fires and take our lives. If we
have been maligned, then let the fiery vengeance seize on the woman who
has said the word and prove to all the people that thou art a jealous
God, watching above thine own.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Even as he spoke, even as his hand was outstretched to
heaven, Ambrosia Lonzello straightened, then lunged forward, her hands
and limbs trembling and shaking; again and again, as the friar&rsquo;s
toe moved, the horrible contortions were repeated. As he completed his
prayer the girl hung limp and heavy on her chains, lifeless.</p>
<p class="par">An instant more the audience was in a turmoil.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A miracle, a miracle!&rdquo; it cried.</p>
<p class="par">Men and women rushed to the altar, crowding and
kneeling, fumbling their rosaries and praying. Lonzello sank into the
chair at the side of the altar. The Jesuit alone was calm and
commanding.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is a miracle. The
Lord has spoken. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2128" href=
"#xd21e2128" name="xd21e2128">104</a>]</span>Strip your fingers and
ears and pockets of jewelry and money, and lay it before him who doeth
wonders in your sight. Woe to the man or woman who refuses, woe upon
the head of such!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Men were groaning, women praying aloud. Money and
jewelry were thrown before the altar in profusion, until hundreds of
dollars in value were piled there. Then the audience was dismissed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Jesuit, turning to Lonzello,
&ldquo;take this stuff and get from the country at once. Your successor
from America has arrived and is in the harbor even now.&rdquo;

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">When Saguanaldo heard of the fate that had
befallen Ambrosia he was almost beside himself with rage and horror. He
determined to be revenged on the Jesuit and Lonzello, and issued orders
for the force to at once prepare for active service. Mrs. Rizal&rsquo;s
singing and speaking began to bear fruit. The story of Ambrosia spread
rapidly through the island, rousing the people to something like
frenzy. They came out in force. Not until now had that feeling which
makes a religious war been stirred, but it was rampant at this time.
Even some of the Spanish friars, who rebelled at being banished from
the islands, joined the revolt. The war had turned, so that it was no
longer Spaniard and native, but the native against both Spain and
America.</p>
<p class="par">They gathered in great numbers before Manila, coming in
pairs and squads. Some were captured, but the United States troops,
appalled at the demonstration that seemed to be even larger than it
really was, fell back into the city, while the insurgents formed on the
hills occupying the rifle pits without. It was raining and the mud was
so deep that all movements were slow and disagreeable. But the
forboding appearance of nature did not discourage the malcontents.
Women and children were there. Some of them were unarmed, but they
gathered stones for throwing and carried them. Others had nothing but
clubs or bolos. But they were all mad for slaughter, ready to die.</p>
<p class="par">Contrary to expectations of the Americans, they did not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2149" href="#xd21e2149" name=
"xd21e2149">106</a>]</span>attack by night. Neither did they make any
demonstration against the Spanish fortress of <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2151" title="Source: CaVite">Cavite</span>. In the early morning
women and children, ragged and showing the poverty that had provoked
the war, drenched by rain, muddy and miserable, marched down the
streets, in irregular lines, shrieking and singing. As they marched,
others came from the houses of Manila and joined them. Again there was
the song:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">He may be a brother of Governor Daft,</p>
<p class="line">But he ain&rsquo;t no friend of mine.</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Instead of an army, it was a mob, something far
harder to handle than an army, especially if it is composed of women
and children. They broke into shops and took things to eat, munching
and screaming as they marched.</p>
<p class="par">Then, while the American troops were besieged with the
mob, Saguanaldo attacked from the rear. As his troops charged on the
American works, women from the rear threw stones at the American
soldiers. The first line of defense was taken. <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2163" title="Source: CaVite">Cavite</span> was silent, having no
part in this battle, and it was well for America it was so; for had the
attack been more complicated, the issue might have been in doubt. Some
said it had been arranged so in advance. As it was, the American army
lay in the mud in its redoubts, with the rain drizzling on them, and
the little pools of water that formed were stained with blood.</p>
<p class="par">Somehow Saguanaldo and an aide penetrated to the
convento and appeared unannounced before Judge Daft, dripping from the
rain and sprinkled with mud.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have a seat, General,&rdquo; said Judge Daft,
affably. &ldquo;You must be very cold. I will order hot coffee
brought.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Thank you, but you need not,&rdquo; Saguanaldo
replied. &ldquo;I am here on a mission of war, not of hospitality. You
have wronged me, Governor, grievously wronged me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;War is not a pink tea affair,&rdquo; returned the
Judge. &ldquo;It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2175" href=
"#xd21e2175" name="xd21e2175">107</a>]</span>can not be prosecuted
without individual harm being done.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I do not refer to that,&rdquo; said the
insurgent. &ldquo;I shall not whimper over hardships and private losses
or wounds that come from war. But you have wounded me in peace, while I
was ally to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I do not see that you are acting as an ally
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, but I was when I went with the American
troops to spy out and defeat the Spaniards. And at the very hour when I
was serving you, and after I had voluntarily given you my office and
surrendered the Philippine republic that we might come under the
protection of the American republic, you set your soldiers to
protecting the Spanish friars, in possession of property which Spanish
soldiers had seized from us. Was that right?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It was a general order. Had the insurgents been
in possession of the property, they would have been protected in it. It
is not my fault if you were not able to hold this property.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But you occupy the conventos, on invitation of
the friars. It puts you under obligation to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I occupied the house you offered. Did that put me
under obligation to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes. But you now war those who were your
allies.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And you war those who were your allies. That
makes us even.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The man whose guest you are<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2195" title="Not in source">,</span> murdered the leader of the
schism, cruelly, and you shield him. He betrayed the faith of the
friar&rsquo;s daughter&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;After she had betrayed her
faith&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;On her father&rsquo;s
solicitation&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So she said. Poor girl, she was evidently
insane.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And then horribly maltreated her. Later he burned
her, as it were, at the stake.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2207" href="#xd21e2207" name="xd21e2207">108</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Judge Daft, amiably,
&ldquo;it is not a part of my duty to quarrel, and I refuse to jower
longer with you. If you want to fight, go and join with those whose
duty it is to fight. If you have a personal grievance, bring civil
suit, and I will hear your cause. Before you go, I shall be pleased if
you will permit me to serve you something warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Saguanaldo was broken in spirit. He was again beaten in
diplomacy. His mission had failed, and, with quivering lip and voice
shaking with emotion, he said farewell, muffled himself in his great
coat and took his departure with his aide.</p>
<p class="par">As he stepped on the street he was met by a detachment
of soldiers, sent out from the convento by the apostolic nuncio, and
placed under arrest. At the same time Violeta stepped before him and
extended his hand:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;General, I am glad to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Saguanaldo struck at him, but missed, because the
soldiers restrained him. The Jesuit very composedly said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nothing is ever made, General, by being
unpleasant. Take the prisoner to American headquarters, and spread the
report that the leader is captured and the insurrection is over.&rdquo;

<h2 class="main"><i>ANNOUNCEMENT</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Diaz, the Dictator&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In thanking all who by their advance subscriptions made
possible the publication of &ldquo;The Friar&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo; I
wish to announce the preparation of another book, entitled &ldquo;Diaz
the Dictator.&rdquo; It will be somewhat longer than this work, and
will be even more dramatic, fuller of action and intrigue, and will
bring events practically to the present.</p>
<p class="par">The real story of Diaz has never been written
understandingly. Why and how he became a dictator; how the masses of
the people of Mexico were made peons; the motives behind his action;
the development of capitalism and the fall of feudalism in Mexico, have
not yet been touched on understandingly. They are told in the
fascinating story which I announce. The near relationship of the United
States to Mexico through it all is made clear.</p>
<p class="par">Not many know that the French government, at the
instance of the Roman <span class="corr" id="xd21e2234" title=
"Source: heirarchy">hierarchy</span>, after the confiscation of the
church lands in Mexico, overthrew the republic in 1863, and established
as a form of government &ldquo;a temperate and hereditary Catholic
monarchy.&rdquo; Not many know that Jaurez, the Mexican president who
was forced from his position by a foreign army, appealed to the United
States for aid, but that this country, being in the midst of a big war,
was unable to lend him succor. Not many know that just as soon as there
was prospect of the American armies being released from war, congress,
on April 4th, 1864, warned France that America <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2237" href="#xd21e2237" name=
"xd21e2237">110</a>]</span>would not, under the Monroe doctrine, permit
an European power to establish a monarchy on American soil. Not many
know that on February 9th, 1869, Abraham Lincoln issued an ultimatum to
France that she must either withdraw her troops from Mexico or fight
the United States&mdash;that France withdrew, and the monarchy went to
pieces. Not many have thought that the plotting against Lincoln&rsquo;s
life, by Catholics exclusively, began on March 6th, 1865, and
culminated on April 15th, 1865. All this time Diaz was fighting with
the Mexican patriots. Do you know what caused him to change?</p>
<p class="par">These are only a few of the things brought out in the
work. If &ldquo;The Friar&rsquo;s Daughter&rdquo; is an eye-opener,
then &ldquo;Diaz the Dictator&rdquo; will prove the thunder clap.</p>
<p class="par">Will you help to bring out this work, as you so
generously helped with &ldquo;The Friar&rsquo;s Daughter&rdquo;? If so,
I ask you to fill out the enclosed blank and mail it to me, WITHOUT
SENDING MONEY. The prices will be the same as with this work:</p>
<p class="par">Ten copies, $3.00; 100 copies, $22.00; single copy, 40
cents.</p>
<p class="par">Enclose in envelope and mail to me, and when the
subscription reaches 1,000 work will be begun on printing &ldquo;Diaz
the Dictator.&rdquo;</p>
